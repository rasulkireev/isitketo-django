Is It Keto was founded in 2018 to educate the world about the keto diet.

I embarked on the keto journey in 2016, but I always struggled to remember which foods fit into the diet. Anyone can count carbs, but there are so many foods with exotic additives or artificial sweeteners, so it was a chore to research every food and every ingredient it contained.

Is It Keto is my effort to collect high-quality information about every food's role in this diet. I hope that you find this information helpful.
