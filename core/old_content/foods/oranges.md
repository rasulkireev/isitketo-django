It's tough to find a good keto fruit. Oranges, sadly, don't make the cut. While oranges are famously high in vitamin C and other healthy nutrients, they're packed with sugars. A medium-sized orange contains over 12 g of net carbs.

If you *really* love oranges, you can perhaps fit half of an orange into your daily carb limits, but you'd be better off finding a more keto-friendly fruit. Consider one of the following:

* [Avocados](/avocados)
* [Raspberries](/raspberries)
* [Tomatoes](/tomatoes)
* [Blackberries](/blackberries)
