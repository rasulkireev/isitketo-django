Hidden Valley Ranch can make a great dressing for your salad or a dipping sauce for your [chicken](/chicken). At only 2 g of net carbs per 2 Tbsp serving, it should be easy to fit within your daily macros.

Stick with the original variety of the dressing. Avoid low-fat variants, as you want more fat and those varieties usually have more sugars.
