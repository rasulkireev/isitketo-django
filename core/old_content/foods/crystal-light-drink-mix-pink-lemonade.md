At only 5 calories per serving and zero carbs, Crystal Light's Pink Lemonade Drink Mix makes an enticing proposition for keto eaters hoping to enjoy a sweet lemonade.

Unfortunately, this drink mix includes maltodextrin, which has been shown to increase blood sugar. It also contains [aspartame](/aspartame) and  [acesulfame potassium](/acesulfame-potassium), which are unpopular sweeteners in the keto community, though there hasn't been conclusive research linking them to negative health effects.
