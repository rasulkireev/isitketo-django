Primal Kitchen's entire ingredient list is all-natural and all-organic.

At only 2 g of carbs per 2 Tbsp serving, this dressing should be easy to fit within your daily macros. Each serving also provides 15 g of fats, one of the highest of any brands of Ranch dressing. As with any [salad dressing](/salad-dressing), Primal Kitchen's Ranch is easy to overeat, so be mindful of your portion sizes to ensure you're staying within your macronutrient limits.
