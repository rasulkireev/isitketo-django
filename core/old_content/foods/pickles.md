Low in everything but sodium, pickles are a great keto-friendly snack. But you need to be careful when choosing your pickles. While [cucumbers](/cucumbers), salt, and vinegar are all low-carb, some manufacturers add [sugar](/sugar) to their brine, a keto no-go. Fortunately, a quick peek at the nutrition label will tell you if your gherkin is sugar-free of sugar-full.

A medium-sized dill pickle contains only 0.9 g of net carbs. But while the carb count is low, you don't want to pig out on pickles. Each pickle also contains around 526 mg of sodium, more than a fifth of the [CDC's recommended limit](https://www.cdc.gov/salt/pdfs/sodium_dietary_guidelines.pdf) of 2,300 mg per day.

Kosher pickles, which are fermented rather than brined, are a great source of probiotics. The microorganisms responsible for fermentation synergize well with the bacteria in your gut, boosting digestive health. To tell a fermented pickle from a brined one, look at the ingredient list: if it includes vinegar, it's a brined pickle. You can taste the difference, too. Fermented pickles will tingle on your tongue, almost like they're carbonated.
