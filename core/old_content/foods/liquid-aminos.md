People often use liquid aminos as a substitute for [soy sauce](/soy-sauce). They taste similar, have a similar consistency, but they contain no wheat. This makes liquid aminos popular among people with wheat sensitivities.

For keto dieters, the advantage of liquid aminos is that they're lower in carbs. Unlike soy sauce, which often includes wheat as an ingredient, liquid aminos are made entirely from either soybeans or [coconuts](/coconut).

The "aminos" in liquid aminos refer to amino acids, which make up proteins. Amino acids serve a critical function [in your body's metabolism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19301095).

## Soy vs. coconut aminos

Most brands of soy-based and coconut-based liquid aminos have 1 g or less of net carbs per tablespoon. Always check the label, however, as some brands, especially of coconut aminos, add massive amounts of [sugar](/sugar) that spike the carb count. In general, soy-based liquid aminos have fewer carbs.

One advantage coconut aminos have over soy-based aminos is their lower sodium content. Soy-based liquid aminos contain roughly the same amount of sodium as soy sauce &mdash; around 1,000 mg per tablespoon. Given that the [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/salt/pdfs/sodium_dietary_guidelines.pdf) that adults eat no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day, each tablespoon eats a huge chunk out of your daily limits.

Coconut aminos have ~70% less sodium per serving. If you're concerned about your sodium intake, coconut aminos might be a nice compromise between carbs and sodium.
