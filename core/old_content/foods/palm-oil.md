If you're craving keto-friendly fish or fried [chicken](/chicken), then palm oil is a great zero-carb option for you, especially if you prefer a milder tasting oil.

For most fried dishes, you should heat the frying oil to 350 to 375° F. This gives your food a crispy exterior while allowing the food to cook all the way through. To fry at this temperature, you need an oil with a high smoke point to avoid a burnt taste and a smoky kitchen. Palm oil's smoke point is 450° F, making it a great oil for high-temperature cooking. It's also milder in taste than other keto-friendly options like coconut or avocado oil.

You'll probably see three types of palm oil in the store: unrefined (also called "red" or "crude"), refined, and palm kernel. Although all three varieties are keto-friendly and come from the same palm fruit, your best bet is unrefined palm oil. It contains the most monounsaturated fat, the good type of fat that [prevents plaque buildup in your heart and blood vessels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4365303/). Unrefined palm oil also delivers more [disease-fighting antioxidants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942711/), as the refining process removes them from the other varieties.
