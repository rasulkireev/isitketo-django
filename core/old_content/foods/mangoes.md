In the words of 90s _Saturday Night Live_ star, Chris Kattan, ["You can't have-a da mango!"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango_(Saturday_Night_Live)>).

On the keto diet, mangoes are off-limits. A cup of mango slices contains 22.1 g of net carbs, a sizeable chunk of any keto dieter's daily carb limit. And a 100 g serving would only account for a small fraction of a mango. Eating an entire mango would cause you to consume 44 g of net carbs, enough to kick most people out of ketosis even in the absence of any other food in your diet. Dried mangoes are even worse, as manufacturers use [sugar](/sugar) to preserve the fruit during the dehydration process.

### Alternatives

Unfortunately, only a few [fruits](/category/fruits) have a low enough carb count to fit the keto diet. Berries tend to be your best bet. Here are a few keto-friendly options:

- [Blackberries](/blackberries)
- [Raspberries](/raspberries)
- [Strawberries](/strawberries)
