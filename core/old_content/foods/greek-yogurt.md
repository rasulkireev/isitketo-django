Greek yogurt is a great way to consume dairy while keeping keto. It contains probiotics and plenty of healthy fats.

Stick to plain, full fat greek yogurt. 2% or low fat greek yogurts are acceptable, but not ideal. Avoid flavored yogurts as they usually are much higher in cabs from the flavoring agents.

### What's the real carb count?

Some keto bloggers claim that the nutrition labels on greek yogurt and other fermented dairy products incorrectly overstate the carb count. They believe that by the time greek yogurt reaches grocery shelves, the healthy bacteria in the yogurt consume the carb-heavy lactose, and convert it to lactic acid.

The idea of the mismeasured carb count seems to have originated from the book [_GO-Diet_](https://amzn.to/2tJ8eSg) by Dr. Jack Goldberg and Dr. Karen O'Mara, but other researchers have not substantiated this claim.
