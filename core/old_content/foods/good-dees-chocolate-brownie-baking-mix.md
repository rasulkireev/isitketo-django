Baked goods are one of the biggest challenges for keto. Most standard baking recipes are high in [sugar](/sugar) and wheat flour, both of which are big no-nos on keto. Most low carb brownie recipes result in brownies that are bland or overly dry.

Good Dee's offers a keto-friendly brownie mix that's astonishingly low in carbs, at only 1 g of net carbs per brownie. The baking mix is easy to use, as you just mix it with some [eggs](/eggs) and [butter](/butter), then pop it in the oven. Twenty minutes later, you've got delicious, keto-friendly brownies. Customers in the keto community describe these brownies as one of the closest tastes they've found to traditional brownies.

Some fans have [adapted the recipe](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XW50HIU5UCVF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01H298206) to make chocolate mug cakes by taking half an egg, 1.5 tbsp of melted butter, and 2 tbsp of brownie mix and baking it in a [coffee](/coffee) mug.

If you've got a sensitive stomach, this brownie mix is a great match as it's grain-free, gluten-free, and soy free.
