Kraft Ranch can make a great dressing for your salad or a dipping sauce for your [chicken](/chicken). At only 2 g of carbs per 2 Tbsp serving, it should be easy to fit within your daily macros.

The buttermilk variety is a bit better for keto eating because it's higher in fats, but Kraft's classic Ranch works as well. Avoid low-fat variants, as you want more fat and those varieties add extra sugars.
