Aspartame is one of the most prevalent artificial sweeteners in the US when it comes to low-calorie foods.

A packet of an aspartame-based sweetener like Equal contains only 0.9 g of net carbs and less than one calorie. Because of this, food manufacturers add aspartame to many sugar-free products, including [Diet Coke](/diet-coke), Orbit gum, and [Jell-O instant sugar-free pudding](/jello-o-sugar-free-instant-pudding-banana-cream).

## Safety

Safety is a concern with any artificial sweetener. There's fierce debate over the safety of many sugar substitutes. Eliminating sugar is great, but nobody wants a replacement that's going to cause health complications.

The hype around aspartame isn't all positive, and one popular fear is that aspartame causes cancer. [An Italian study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17119233) of the effects of aspartame on rats suggested a possible link between the sweetener and an increased risk for blood-related cancers, but [later studies on humans](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/aspartame.html) contradicted those results.

Ultimately, the FDA found that it's safe to use aspartame in foods and beverages. The FDA does warn that a minority of people with a rare hereditary disease called phenylketonuria (PKU) should avoid aspartame, as they can't metabolize it.

## Alternatives

For a more natural alternative, consider [stevia](/stevia) or [monk fruit](/monk-fruit). Both are all-natural and have nearly zero effect on blood sugar.

Other popular keto-friendly sweeteners include [erythritol](/erythritol) and [xylitol](/xylitol). They're sugar alcohols, which humans can't digest, so you get the sweetness without the carbs.
