Powerade Zero is a popular drink among those who keep keto, as it contains zero calories and <1 g of net carbs

Powerade Zero's sweeteners are [sucralose](/sucralose) and [acesulfame potassium](/acesulfame-potassium), which provide its sweet-without-sugar flavor. While some sweeteners can have negative health impacts, more than [100 FDA-reviewed studies](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/additional-information-about-high-intensity-sweeteners-permitted-use-food-united-states) support the safety of these two sweeteners.

Sports drinks often boast that they're full of electrolytes, but few people understand what electrolytes are or how they affect the body. Sodium and potassium, Powerade Zero's two primary electrolytes, regulate muscle function. Heavy exercise can drain your electrolytes, leaving your muscles tired, dehydrated, and cramped. After a vigorous workout or a long hike, the quick shot of electrolytes in Powerade Zero can help you recover.

Although you're less likely to be drinking alcohol on the keto diet, electrolyte depletion is part of what makes hangovers so unpleasant. If you're ever suffering after a night of heavy drinking, Powerade Zero can help you feel better while sticking to your keto regimen.
