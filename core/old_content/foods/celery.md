Celery may not wear a cape, but it's often called a superfood because it's low in calories, has only 1.4 g of net carbs per cup and contains a variety of antioxidant-rich vitamins and minerals. Plus, it's 95% [water](/water) and high in fiber, making you feel full longer.

Besides its nutritional stat sheet, keto eaters love celery for its ability to scoop up delicious appetizers. At your next get-together, choose celery instead of chips for your queso or buffalo chicken dip.
