Mayonnaise is the most popular condiment in America, and Primal Kitchen's mayo has gained popularity among keto eaters who want an organic option.

[Primal Kitchen](https://www.primalkitchen.com/?rfsn=4301510.95e924&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=4301510.95e924) made its name as the first mainstream brand to sell mayo with avocado oil instead of soybean or rapeseed oil, giving you more monounsaturated fat per serving. Nutrition experts often describe monounsaturated fat as a "healthy fat" as it helps your body better [absorb other nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15735074). After Primal Kitchen's success, other popular brands added avocado oil mayo varieties to their line-ups.

Primal Kitchen offers four keto-friendly flavors of mayo:

* [Plain Avocado Oil](https://www.primalkitchen.com/collections/mayo/products/avocado-oil-mayo?rfsn=4301510.95e924&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=4301510.95e924)
