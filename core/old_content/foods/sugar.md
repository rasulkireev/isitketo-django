Sugar is one of the most addictive ingredients on earth, and it's also one of the first ingredients you eliminate when going keto. Why? Because sugar causes insulin spikes that prevent ketosis. After you eat sugar, your energy level crashes and you're left craving more carbs.

One teaspoon of white granulated sugar contains 4.2 g of net carbs, and other varieties aren't much better. Brown sugar contains 2.9 g, and there's 2.9 g in each teaspoon of powdered sugar. Keto newbies often want to incorporate sugar into their allotted carb limits, but you're better off cutting sugar altogether to end your sugar cravings and prevent interruptions to ketosis.

Luckily, a sugarless life doesn't mean giving up sweets completely. Natural sweeteners and sugar alcohols are the best low-carb sugar substitutes to use in beverages and baked desserts. Here are a few keto-friendly options:

* [Erythritol](/erythritol)
* [Stevia](/stevia)
* [Monk Fruit](/monk-fruit)
* [Truvia](/truvia)
* [Xylitol](/xylitol)
