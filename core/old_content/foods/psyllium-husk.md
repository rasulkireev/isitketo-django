Psyllium is a natural fiber that has been shown to treat digestive issues such as constipation, as well as [improve heart health](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7948457&fileId=S0007114510003132).

A single teaspoon of psyllium husk contains 4 g of total carbs, but this is entirely from fiber, so it's 0 g net carbs. It contains almost zero proteins or fats, so it won't help you hit your macros, but you can take some psyllium if you want a bit more fiber in your diet.

The powdered fiber supplement [Metamucil](/metamucil) is primarily pysllium husk, though it is not keto due to its sweeteners.
