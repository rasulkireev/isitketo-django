With potato chips off the table for keto (no pun intended), what snack will accompany our bunless burgers? Without tortilla chips, what will we dip in our guacamole? Fortunately, Whisps provide an answer. They're the keto-friendly mock-chips you never knew you always wanted.

Whisps look like tiny potato chips, but they're actually small, crispy slices of [parmesan cheese](/cheese). There are several different flavors of Whisps, but they're all keto-friendly at 1 g of net carb per serving. The BBQ Bacon Cheddar variety comes in a little higher at 2 g of net carbs, but even that's still a very low carb count. They serve a healthy amount of fats, at 10 to 14 g, depending on the variety. They're also high in protein, with the different flavors ranging from 10 to 12 g per serving.

The only two Whisp varieties that are non-keto are Ranch and Nacho Cheese. Both of these flavors contain maltodextrin, a non-keto sweetener that can spike your blood sugar and interfere with ketosis.

Just like regular parmesan, Whisps pair well with a nice Merlot or Syrah. Or do as the Germans do and have it with your beer.
