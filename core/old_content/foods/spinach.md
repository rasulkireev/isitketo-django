Did you eat your spinach growing up? Mom touted all the health benefits, but there's a reason you declined. While this little green is packed with nutrients, it's not exactly full of flavor. Don't despair. It's not hard to spice up this keto-friendly veg.

Try pairing it with silky [sour cream](/sour-cream) and some tangy parmesan for a low-carb creamed spinach. Looking for something lighter? Mix it with [watercress](/watercress) and [avocado](/avocados). Drizzle on some lemon juice, avocado oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper for a [keto-friendly salad](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=spinach%20salad) rich in healthy fats. Need an [easy, high-fat breakfast](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=spinach%20eggs&category=breakfast)? Pop it in a pan with some [eggs](/eggs), another keto star.

Spinach might not taste the best, but it won't break your heart. In fact, this leafy green [protects your heart](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319645.php) with Vitamin K and is as keto-friendly as they come.
