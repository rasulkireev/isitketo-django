Quinoa, a grain native to South America, has gone from health food store obscurity to casual dining darling in the last several years. That's because this grain is packed with fiber, iron, and protein.

Tragically, it's too starchy for keto. A single 100 g serving contains 18.5 g of net carbs, which is far too high to fit into a low-carb diet. As an alternative, opt for keto-friendly options such as riced [broccoli](/broccoli) or [cauliflower](/cauliflower).
