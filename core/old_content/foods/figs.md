Each serving of figs (1 medium, 2-1/4" diameter) contains 8.1 g of net carbs. That's on the high side, but you can still squeeze in small amounts if you've got a strong craving for this tasty fruit.

Consider limiting yourself to half a portion per day to avoid going over your carb limits.

Though fresh figs fit the keto diet, canned or dried figs do not. Packaged figs contain tons of added [sugar](/sugar) that manufacturers use as a preservative.
