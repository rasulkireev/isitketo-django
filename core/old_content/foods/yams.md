Though a popular dish at Thanksgiving time, yams are not welcome at the keto table. With over 35 g of net carbs per cup, this starchy vegetable is as un-keto as they come.

As a general rule, vegetables that grow underground are not keto-friendly. For a keto-friendly yam alternative, consider [rutabaga](/rutabaga) or [cauliflower](/cauliflower).
