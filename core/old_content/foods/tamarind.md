Tamarind is a type of fruit native to Africa. Tamarind tress bear small brown pods of fruit which contain a sweet pulp.

Tamarind is particularly popular in Indian cuisine, where its extract is often used in curries and chutneys. In fact, the word "tamarind" is based on the Arabic "tamar hind," which translates loosely to "Indian [date](/dates)."

Each serving of tamarind (0.5 tamarind) contains 0.6 g of net carbs.

Though fresh tamarind fits the keto diet, canned or dried tamarind does not. Packaged tamarind contains tons of added [sugar](/sugar) that manufacturers use as a preservative.
