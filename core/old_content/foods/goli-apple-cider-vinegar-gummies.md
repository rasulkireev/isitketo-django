Within the keto community, drinking [apple cider vinegar](/apple-cider-vinegar) is a popular way to reduce cravings for carbs. For those that don't enjoy the vinegar as a drink, apple cider vinegar gummies (commonly known as "ACV gummies") are a way to work apple cider vinegar into your diet as chewable candies.

As the first mainstream manufacturer, Goli is the most popular brand of ACV gummies, and one of the most keto-friendly brands. That said, each Goli gummy contains 1 g of [sugar](/sugar), bringing it to a total of 3.5 g of net carbs per serving.

For keto dieters, there isn't much reason to choose goli gummies over regular apple cider vinegar. If you take apple cider vinegar to suppress your carb cravings, it's obviously silly to eat it in conjunction with a 3.5 g of additional carbs. But if you simply hate the taste of regular apple cider vinegar and find that ACV gummies aid your digestion and improve your health, you can usually fit one in under your daily carb limit.

## Alternatives

While Goli is the most popular apple cider vinegar brand, there are a few others that have fewer net carbs per serving:

* [Dakota](https://amzn.to/2ZdtvEZ) (2 g net carbs)
* [Lunaki](https://amzn.to/3bvOwgl) (3 g net carbs)

If apple cider vinegar's taste is what puts you off drinking it in liquid form, another alternative is to take it in pill form. There are several brands that offer keto-friendly apple cider vinegar capsules with no added sugar:

* [Herbtonics](https://amzn.to/2z04QZH) (0 net carbs)
* [NutriFlair](https://amzn.to/367jcDQ) (0 net carbs)
