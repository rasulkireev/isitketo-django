Russell Stover sugar-free chocolates have a nutrition label that's very enticing to keto eaters. Each serving contains 20 g of total carbs, but 17 g come from sugar alcohols and 1 g comes from fiber, so the standard calculation of net carbs implies that these candies only have 2 g of net carbs. However, a careful inspection of the ingredients list raises big red flags.

The primary ingredient in these candies is [maltitol](/maltitol). It's a sugar alcohol, but it's not a keto-friendly one like [stevia](/stevia) or [erythritol](/erythritol). Maltitol's glycemic index is 36, so it spikes blood sugar and can interfere with ketosis. For comparison, sucrose (table sugar) has a glycemic index of 65, so maltitol isn't much better than normal sugar.

If you're craving a keto-friendly chocolate, try [Lily's Chocolate Bars](https://amzn.to/2VyxV4M). Lily's sweetens their chocolate with erythritol and stevia, which both have a glycemic index of zero, so they don't interfere with ketosis.
