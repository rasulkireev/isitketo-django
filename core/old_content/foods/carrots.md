A 1 cup serving of carrots contains 8.7 g of net carbs, so you can usually fit a full or half serving into your daily limit. They are, nevertheless, high in starch, so keep a careful eye on the amount you consume.

The antioxidant properties of carrots [improve your immune system](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/effects-of-carotenoids-on-human-immune-function/8C0275BFE29D8C343A2CA18B62062483) and [reduce the risk of some cancers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21864090%20). One of the best-known nutritional benefits of carrots is their abundance of vitamin A, which can improve eyesight. However, most people in developed countries get enough vitamin A in their normal diets, so the effects of carrots on eyesight are negligible.

Raw carrots make great vehicles for keto dips like [ranch](/ranch-dressing) and french onion. Carrots can also serve as a keto-friendly substitute for [potatoes](/potatoes). Craving a baked potato? Roast some carrots in the oven. Missing that side of mashed potatoes? Boil carrots on the stovetop and then mash them up. You can even add carrots to a hearty crockpot stew.
