Whether you want smoked salmon for brunch, canned salmon in a lunch salad, or salmon filet for dinner, rest assured that it won't increase your daily carb count. If you need a break from red meat and poultry, salmon is a great main course.

Salmon is one of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids, an essential fat that your body cannot produce. Research even shows that adding omega-3s to your diet [improves the function of your heart, blood vessels and arteries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22317966). Plus, salmon is an excellent source of protein and potassium.

Salmon itself has no carbs, but be careful when you prepare it. If you pan-fry or bake salmon, use [extra virgin olive oil](/olive-oil) or real [butter](/butter) with sugar-free seasonings. To round out the meal, add some steamed [broccoli](/broccoli) or baked [asparagus](/asparagus) as a tasty complement.

No [water](/water) source is perfect, so all species of fish absorb contaminants to some degree. A 2004 study revealed that [farmed salmon posed greater health risks than wild-caught salmon](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/303/5655/226). But, global efforts in the last 40 years have [drastically reduced contaminants](https://peerj.com/articles/1573/) in the fish we eat. To be on the safe side, do your research before serving fish to women who are pregnant or nursing, seniors, or children.
