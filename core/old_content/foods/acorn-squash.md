Each serving of acorn squash (1 cup, cubes) contains 12.5 g of net carbs. Unfortunately, that's a bit too high to be appropriate for the keto diet.

### Alternatives

For a lower carb squash, consider a nice [zucchini](/zucchini). With only 2.6 g of net carbs per serving, zucchini offers a lower-starch squash alternative to acorn squash.

[Spaghetti squash](/spaghetti-squash) is another great keto-friendly squash, which is why you often find it as an ingredient in [keto pasta dishes](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q="spaghetti%20squash"&category=entree). At only 5.5 g of net carbs, it's a great way to simulate the taste of delicious pasta without packing on pasta-level carbs.
