manual_intro: Black eyed peas are decidedly not keto. The food, that is. The musical
  group, [Black Eyed Peas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Eyed_Peas) may
  very well be keto-friendly. We're still waiting for will.i.am to return our emails

Black eyed peas are decidedly not keto. The food, that is. The musical group, [Black Eyed Peas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Eyed_Peas) may very well be keto-friendly. We're still waiting for will.i.am to return our emails to confirm.

Each serving of black eyed peas (1 cup) contains 25.1 g of net carbs. Sadly, that's far too carb-heavy to fit the keto diet.

### Alternatives

For a similar but keto-friendly alternative, consider [black soy beans](/black-soy-beans). They're high in protein, rich in antioxidants, and contain only 2 g of net carbs per cup.
