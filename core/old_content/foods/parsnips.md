Parsnips are a root vegetable, close relatives of [carrot](/carrots) and parsley. People eat them the same way they eat carrots &mdash; as raw vegetables or cooked as a side to complement another dish.

Each serving of parsnips (1 cup slices) contains 17.4 g of net carbs. Sadly, that's far too carb-heavy to fit the keto diet.

As a general rule, root vegetables rarely fit the keto diet. They're often too starchy, unlike leafy green veggies, which are mostly keto-friendly.

### Alternatives

For a lower carb root vegetable, consider the [radish](/radishes). At only 2.1 g of net carbs per serving, radishes certainly leave parsnips in the dust.
