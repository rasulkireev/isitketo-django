Each serving of plums (1 plum, 2-1/8" diameter) contains 6.6 g of net carbs. That's a sizeable amount, but plums are still one of the most keto-friendly fruits you can find.

Though fresh plums fit the keto diet, canned or dried plums do not. Packaged plums contain tons of added [sugar](/sugar) that manufacturers use as a preservative.
