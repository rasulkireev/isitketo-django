Star fruit is a uniquely shaped fruit from tropical Southeast Asia. Depending on the region, it's sometimes called carambola or birambi. You can eat it raw, but it's often prepared into juices or relishes.

Each serving of star fruit (1 cup, sliced) contains 4.2 g of net carbs. That's a sizeable amount, but star fruit is still one of the most keto-friendly fruits you can find.
