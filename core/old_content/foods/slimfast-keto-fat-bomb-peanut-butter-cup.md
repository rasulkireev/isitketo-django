SlimFast's Peanut Butter fat bombs are an impressive achievement.  They're sweetened with [erythritol](/erythritol) and [stevia](/stevia), two of the most keto-friendly sweeteners. This results in a tasty snack that's only 1 g of net carbs per serving. Keep in mind that the serving size is a single peanut butter cup, but it's still a very keto snack.

Most products that boast a low carb nutrition label do so by hiding some skeletons in their ingredient list, but that's not the case with these peanut butter cups. A review of the ingredients reveals no alarming chemicals or additives. The one red flag ingredient is peanut oil, which some keto experts discourage because of its [undesirable proportion of omega-6s to omega-3s](https://www.ruled.me/omega-3-omega-6-essential-fatty-acids/). Regardless, these peanut butter cups are very low in peanut oil, so it's not cause for concern.
