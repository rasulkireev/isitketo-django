Beans are a heartbreaker for keto eaters. They *seem* like they should be keto-friendly, as they're high in protein. Sadly, they're also packed with carbs. Most beans have between 11 and 15 g of net carbs in each half-cup serving, which is far too high for a side dish. If you tried to eat a whole meal of beans, you'd kick yourself out of ketosis in no time.

Fortunately, there is one standout in the stark bean world. [Black soy beans](/black-soy-beans) break all the bean norms and provide a compelling set of macros. Cooked or canned, they have only 1 g of net carbs per half-cup serving. And if that weren't enough, they have 11 g of protein and 6 g of fat.

For the rest of the bean kingdom, the numbers aren't so pretty. Here are how some a 1/2 cup serving of common bean varieties stack up against black soy beans:

| Variety | Net Carbs | Protein | Fat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Black Soy Beans](/black-soy-beans) | 1 g | 11 g | 6 g |
| [Black Beans](/black-beans) | 11 g | 8 g | 0 g |
| Cannelini Beans | 11 g | 6 g | 0 g |
| [Lima Beans](/lima-beans) | 12 g | 6 g | 0 g |
| [Kidney Beans](/kidney-beans) (Dark Red) | 12 g | 8 g | 0 g |
| Garbanzo Beans | 14 g | 6 g | 2 g |
