Each serving of rutabaga (1 cup) contains 8.8 g of net carbs. That's higher than you'd like to be for a vegetable, but you can fit in small amounts if you've got a strong hankering for rutabaga.

Consider limiting yourself to half a portion per day to avoid going over your carb limits.

### Vitamins and nutrients

Rutabaga contains 39% of your [daily value of vitamin C](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/), an essential antioxidant that [can help prevent cardiovascular disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17884994).

Rutabaga is a cruciferous vegetable, a family of crop species that includes [kale](/kale) and [broccoli](/broccoli). Scientists are interested in cruciferous vegetables because of evidence that suggests that they [contain compounds that prevent cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cruciferous-vegetables-fact-sheet). More research is needed, but several studies have found that people who consume cruciferous vegetables like rutabaga are [less likely to develop lung](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11078758) or [colon cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11117618).

### Alternatives

For a lower carb root vegetable, consider the [radish](/radishes). At only 2.1 g of net carbs per serving, radishes certainly leave rutabaga in the dust.
