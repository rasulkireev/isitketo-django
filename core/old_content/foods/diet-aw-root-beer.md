Diet A&W Root Beer has zero carbs. That makes it an ideal choice when you want to enjoy the taste of soda without breaking your ketosis.

One of the biggest challenges of a keto diet is staying properly hydrated. It's fine to mix in a bit of soda for taste, but the best way to hydrate is by drinking plenty of [water](/water).

### Sweeteners

The primary sweetener in Diet A&W Root Beer is [aspartame](/aspartame), a sweetener that has attracted more controversy in the last twenty years than almost any other food product. A [2006 animal study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16507461) initially launched the debate over aspartame, as it suggested that aspartame increases the risk of cancer. That study was [widely panned](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1797853/), and subsequent analyses, including one by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), [found no link](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/131210) between cancer and normal aspartame consumption.

Diet A&W Root Beer also contains [acesulfame potassium](/acesulfame-potassium), sometimes known as "Ace-K". Acesulfame potassium is an unpopular ingredient in the keto community, though more than [100 FDA-reviewed studies](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/additional-information-about-high-intensity-sweeteners-permitted-use-food-united-states) support its safety.

A small number of people have found that artificial sweeteners can interfere with their ketosis. If you're not sure whether your body reacts negatively to artificial sweeteners, experiment with Diet A&W Root Beer in small portions before integrating it into your normal diet.

### Alternatives

For a soda without artificial sweeteners, consider [Zevia](/zevia-soda). It's sweetened with [stevia](/stevia), a natural, keto-friendly sweetener that does not increase blood sugar.

You can also create your own keto-friendly soda at home. Devices like [Sodastream](https://amzn.to/2Roev3z) or the [Hamilton Beach Fizzini](https://amzn.to/2CJisHF) make it possible to create your own keto sodas while controlling every ingredient you use.
