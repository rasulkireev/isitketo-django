Bread and fruit: two food groups that keto dieters miss the most. Although breadfruit has no real nutritional links to wheat bread, it's too sugary for keto.

Each serving of breadfruit (1 cup) contains a whopping 48.9 g of net carbs. Sadly, that's far too carb-heavy to fit the keto diet.

### Alternatives

Unfortunately, only a few [fruits](/category/fruits) have a low enough carb count to fit the keto diet. If you're dying for some fruit, berries tend to be your best bet. Here are a few keto-friendly options:

- [Blackberries](/blackberries)
- [Raspberries](/raspberries)
- [Strawberries](/strawberries)

Although it may not spring to mind when you think "fruit," [avocados](/avocados) are the most keto-friendly fruit you can find. They're high in healthy fats and have a low carb profile, making them ideal for keto.
