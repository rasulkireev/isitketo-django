When we say added sugar, we don't mean a few trace carbs. The typical honey-cured ham contains 2 - 4 g of carbs for every two-slice serving, and glazed ham is even more carb-heavy. Limited to special occasions, honey-cured ham is harmless, but eating it regularly will throw you out of ketosis.

To avoid added carbs, seek out uncured ham. [Applegate Farms](https://amzn.to/36GN3lx) is a popular brand for uncured meat. If you can't find uncured ham, focus on the nutrition label. Some brands of ham remain at 0 g of net carbs even after curing.

A single serving contains 23% of your daily recommended dose of zinc, which your body uses to regulate immune function, heal wounds, and even [fight the common cold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3394849/). Each serving of ham also supplies 53% of your daily requirement of selenium, which is necessary for hormone production.

There's more to ham than just sandwiches. Mix it with [eggs](/eggs), [cheese](/cheese), and [tomatoes](/tomatoes) to make a delicious quiche. Or add ham to your favorite salad.
