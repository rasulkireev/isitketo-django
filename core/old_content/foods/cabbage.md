Crunchy with a light flavor, cabbage is an easy vegetable to incorporate into keto menus. It has tender leaves that are great in slaws or salads. Cabbage is also hearty enough to hold up in soups, stir-fries, or braises.

Green cabbage – maybe the most common variety in your local grocery store – has just under 3 g of net carbs per cup. This superfood is also packed with vitamins A, C, and K, as well as magnesium, antioxidants, fiber, and other nutrients. Savoy cabbage has about the same number of net carbs as green cabbage. [Red cabbage](/red-cabbage) comes in at the carb heaviest, at 4.7 g of net carbs.

The easiest ways to incorporate cabbage? Try making a vinegar-based coleslaw or salad, toss a handful into soup, or braise a few thick slices.
