Spaghetti squash contains 5.5 g of net carbs per serving, which isn't fantastically low, but isn't high either. Its carb contents are small enough to be unlikely to boot you out of ketosis.

Spaghetti squash is a popular ingredient in many [keto pasta dishes](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q="spaghetti%20squash"&category=entree).
