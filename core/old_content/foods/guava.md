Each serving of guava (1 guava, common) contains 4.9 g of net carbs. That's a sizeable amount, but guava is still one of the most keto-friendly fruits you can find.

Though fresh guava fits the keto diet, canned or dried guava does not. Packaged guava contains tons of added [sugar](/sugar) that manufacturers use as a preservative.

### Vitamins and nutrients

Guava contains 140% of your [daily value of vitamin C](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/), an essential antioxidant that [can help prevent cardiovascular disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17884994).
