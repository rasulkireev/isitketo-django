Pretty please with a cherry on top? Unfortunately, not. If you're sticking to keto, you won't want to put a cherry on top of anything.

A standard 140 g serving of fresh cherries (roughly 1 cup) contains 19.5 g of net carbs, an enormous amount for anyone on a low-carb diet. Each individual cherry has about 1.2 g of net carbs, so you can have one or two, but you're better off choosing more [keto-friendly fruits](/category/fruits).

Dried cherries are even worse. A cup of dried cherries contains an astronomical 94 g of net carbs. As is the case with most dried fruits, manufacturers add [sugar](/sugar) during the dehydration process, drastically increasing the cherries' carb content.

Instead of cherries, turn to these keto-friendly alternatives:

* [Blackberries](/blackberries)
* [Raspberries](/raspberries)
* [Strawberries](/strawberries)
