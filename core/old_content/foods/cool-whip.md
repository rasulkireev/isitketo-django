Cool Whip is fairly low in carbs. There are several different varieties of Cool Whip, but they are all 2-3 g of net carbs, which consumes a relatively small portion of your daily carb limits.

The real problem with Cool Whip is its ingredient list. Its first ingredient after [water](/water)? High fructose corn syrup. Not an ingredient you want when you're trying to maintain ketosis.

## Alternatives

Why bother with Cool Whip when it's simple to make your own keto-friendly version?

Combine [heavy whipping cream](/heavy-whipping-cream), vanilla, and a keto-friendly sweetener like [stevia](/stevia) or [erythritol](/erythritol). Throw them into a blender, [Magic Bullet](https://amzn.to/2GPMzBD), or just whip them by hand. The result will be a delicious keto-friendly whipped cream.
