Chicken, like virtually all meat, is keto-friendly. Chicken can be found in many [keto recipes](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org?q=chicken).

Chicken offers a high amount of protein and fat, with zero carbs. Chicken breasts are higher in protein, while thighs are higher in fat, with legs falling in between.
