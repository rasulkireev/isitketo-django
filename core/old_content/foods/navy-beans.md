The navy bean is a dry white bean native to North America. It goes by many names: "haricot," "pearl haricot bean," "boston bean," "white pea bean," or "pea bean."

Each serving of navy beans (1 cup) contains 28.3 g of net carbs. Sadly, that's far too carb-heavy to fit the keto diet.

As a rule of thumb, beans do not fit the keto diet. They tend to be high in starches and low in fat, the opposite of what you want on keto.

### Alternatives

If you need a bean to satisfy your bean craving, [black soy beans](/black-soy-beans) are a popular keto-friendly bean. They're high in protein, rich in antioxidants, and only contain 2 g of net carbs per cup.
