Each serving of durians (1 cup, chopped or diced) contains a whopping 56.6 g of net carbs. Sadly, that's far too carb-heavy to fit the keto diet.

### Alternatives

Unfortunately, only a few [fruits](/category/fruits) have a low enough carb count to fit the keto diet. If you're dying for some fruit, berries tend to be your best bet. Here are a few keto-friendly options:

- [Blackberries](/blackberries)
- [Raspberries](/raspberries)
- [Strawberries](/strawberries)

Although it may not spring to mind when you think "fruit," [avocados](/avocados) are the most keto-friendly fruit you can find. They're high in healthy fats and have a low carb profile, making them ideal for keto.
