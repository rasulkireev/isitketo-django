Water is, of course, keto. No way of eating would be complete without the original soft drink: Hâ‚‚0.

While staying keto, it's especially important to hydrate, as ketosis causes your body to retain less water. There's no specific amount of water you need to drink every day; drink whenever you're thirsty. Keep a bottle or glass of water accessible to you throughout the day to ensure that you hydrate regularly. You can also stay hydrated by eating vegetables that are high in water, like [lettuce](/lettuce) and [celery](/celery).

If you're looking for some more flavor in your water, [La Croix Sparkling Water](/la-croix-sparkling-water) and [Sparkling Ice](/sparkling-ice) are both zero-carb options for sparkling water.
