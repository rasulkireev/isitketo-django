Black beans are unfortunately incompatible with the keto diet. Just one cup of black beans contains a whopping 91 g of net carbs, which is enormous for a side dish.

If you need a bean to satisfy your bean craving, [black soy beans](/black-soy-beans) are a popular keto-friendly bean. They're high in protein, rich in antioxidants, and only contain 2 g of net carbs per cup.
