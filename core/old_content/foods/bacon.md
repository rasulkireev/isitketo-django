A 4 oz serving of bacon, roughly four slices, has over 15 g protein, 42 g fat, and zero carbs, making it very popular in the keto community.

Uncured bacon is generally a safer choice, as some brands cure their bacon using [sugar](/sugar). When in doubt, simply check the ingredients and choose brands that don't use sugar or other sweeteners. That said, even bacon cured with sugar is pretty keto-friendly, as the sugars don't add much to the total carb count.
