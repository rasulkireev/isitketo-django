Ken's Foods Steakhouse Ranch can make a great dressing for your salad or a dipping sauce for your [chicken](/chicken).

Ken's Foods offers one of the most keto-friendly ranch dressings of any brand. Their buttermilk ranch contains a whopping 20 g of fat per 2 tablespoon serving with only 1 g of net carbs. Their classic Ranch is almost as good, with 15 g of fat and 2 g of net carbs. Both are excellent for someone trying to meet their fat targets for the day while minimizing their carb intake.
