Pork is meat from pigs, and it goes by many different names. In addition to the specific cuts, the pork "umbrella" covers [ham](/ham), [bacon](/bacon), spare ribs, and more. Like all [meat](/category/meats), pork is extremely keto-friendly. It's composed of lots of protein, some fat, and no carbs.

It's easy to think "pigs are fat; therefore, pork is fatty," but that isn't necessarily true. In fact, the [National Pork Board](https://www.pork.org/) used to advertise pork as "the other white meat." They've since retired the ad (it's now: "Pork. Be inspired"), but many cuts of pork, such as tenderloin and pork chops, are still as lean as [chicken breast](/chicken).

While the micronutrients in pork are consistent across cuts, the specific amounts vary. A typical 4 oz serving pork will contain ~30% of your daily recommended dose of zinc, which promotes immune system health, and ~60% of your daily recommended dose of selenium, which is necessary for thyroid hormone production. Lean cuts of pork tend to have the most nutrients, while processed cuts, such as bacon, usually contain the least.

From barbecue pulled pork to honey-roasted ham, lots of classic pork dishes contain added [sugar](/sugar). Watch out for these keto-unfriendly additives when you're ordering pork at a restaurant or enjoying your in-laws' Christmas ham.
