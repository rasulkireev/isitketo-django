Celeriac, also known as "celery root" is a type of [celery](/celery) grown for its edible root bulb. Unlike celery, celeriac is a very starchy vegetable.

Each serving of celeriac (1 cup, pieces) contains 12 g of net carbs. Unfortunately, that's a bit too high to be appropriate for the keto diet.

As a general rule, root vegetables rarely fit the keto diet. They're often too starchy, unlike leafy green veggies, which are mostly keto-friendly.

### Alternatives

For a lower carb root vegetable, consider the [radish](/radishes). At only 2.1 g of net carbs per serving, radishes certainly leave celeriac in the dust.
