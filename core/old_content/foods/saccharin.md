Saccharin is a zero-carb, zero-calorie sugar-alternative that's about 300 times sweeter than [sugar](/sugar) and has no effect on blood sugar levels, making it friendly for those keeping keto. You can find saccharin in pink Sweet'N Low packets at restaurants and in many sugar-free foods.

Saccharin is stable at high temperatures, so you use it to replace sugar in baking recipes. However, keto eaters report that too much saccharin gives food a bitter or metallic taste, which is why many of them use natural sweeteners or sugar alcohols instead.

People avoided saccharin for three decades because a 1970 study [reported a link between saccharin and bladder cancer in rats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5442712). Critics questioned the study's relevance to humans, as the doses rats consumed before experiencing negative health effects would be [the equivalent of a human drinking 800 sodas per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3185898/). Further studies, including over 30 human trials [found no links between saccharin and cancer](https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm397725.htm#Saccharin), so the FDA has since deemed saccharin safe to eat.

If you'd prefer a natural keto-friendly sweetener, consider [stevia](/stevia) or [monk fruit](/monk-fruit) instead.
