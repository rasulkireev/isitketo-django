Regular Strength 5-Hour Energy Shots have zero carbs. That means you can easily fit them into your diet without affecting your ketosis, though they do contain more artifical sweeteners than natural alternatives like [black coffee](/coffee).

### Vitamins and nutrients

5-Hour Energy Shots are high in niacin, a B vitamin that supports the health of your nervous system and digestive system. They contain 30 times of your [daily value of vitamin B6](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/), which supports cardiovascular health and strengthens your nervous system. They contain 200 times of your [daily value of vitamin B12](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/), which may reduce your risk of [anemia](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vitamin-b12-deficiency-anemia) and [osteoperosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15619681).

Relative to foods like nuts and leafy greens, 5-Hour Energy Shots are low in nutrients. Enjoy them in moderation, but don't let your indulgence push out other, healthier carbs.

### Sweeteners

The primary sweetener in 5-Hour Energy Shots is [sucralose](/sucralose), a common keto-friendly sugar alcohol. While some sweeteners are associated with negative health effects, more than [100 FDA-reviewed studies](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/additional-information-about-high-intensity-sweeteners-permitted-use-food-united-states) support the safety of sucralose.

A small number of people have found that sucralose can interfere with their ketosis. If you're not sure whether your body reacts negatively to sucralose, experiment with 5-Hour Energy Shots in small portions before integrating it into your normal diet.
