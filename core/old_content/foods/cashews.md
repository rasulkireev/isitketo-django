The cashew is one of the worst nuts to eat while keeping keto. A 2 oz serving (roughly 36 cashews) contains 15 g of net carbs.

If you're craving a nutty snack or need a quick energy boost, choose keto-friendly nuts. For the same 2 oz serving size, you can eat 19 [pecans](/pecans) for only 1 g of net carbs or 20 [macadamia nuts](/macadamia-nuts) for only 3 g of net carbs.
