South Forty sunflower seeds are a keto-friendly snack with an excellent macronutrient profile. With just 4 g of net carbs in a Â¼ cup serving, they're easy to fit into your keto diet. At 15 g of fat, they'll keep you satisfied longer.

Sunflower seeds are full of vitamins and minerals. A single serving contains 37% of your daily recommended intake of vitamin E, which is critical to proper brain function. Sunflower seeds are also a significant source of copper, which is necessary for red blood cell production, and vitamin B6, which promotes cardiovascular health.

South Forty sunflower seeds are a great alternative to salty, carb-heavy snacks like potato chips. But while they are keto-friendly, they aren't carb-free. To save yourself the pain of eating all your carbs in one sitting, measure out your servings ahead of time. You can use a measuring cup or eyeball it &mdash; the important thing is not to eat the whole bag.

If you've never eaten sunflower seeds, the process is a bit unintuitive. Check out [this wikiHow](https://wikihow.com/Eat-Sunflower-Seeds) for a visual guide to eating sunflower seeds.
