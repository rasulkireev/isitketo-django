Mayonnaise is the most popular condiment in America. Keto eaters love it because it's low in carbs, high in fat, and makes keto recipes delicious.

Kraft mayonnaise is carb-free, which is great for mayo-heavy recipes like egg salad and homemade [ranch dressing](/ranch-dressing). It also contains 10 g of fat, most of which is unsaturated fat that helps your body absorb other nutrients.

The Kraft brand offers other mayos that are nutritionally similar to the standard flavor, including [Chipotle Aioli](https://amzn.to/2U2sXw7), [Garlic Aioli](https://amzn.to/2EoHeO9), and [Mayo with Avocado Oil](https://amzn.to/2XeOtjc). Avoid the Kraft varieties that are lower in fat and higher in carbs, such as Olive Oil, Light, and Fat-Free Mayo.

If you're looking for an even more keto-compatible mayo, check out [Primal Kitchen's Mayonnaise](https://amzn.to/2BLPd6e). It's zero net carbs and is 20% higher in fat than Kraft.
