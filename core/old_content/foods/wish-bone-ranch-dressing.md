Wish-Bone Ranch Dressing makes a great dipping sauce for your [buffalo wings](/buffalo-wings) or a nice topping for your [keto salad](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=salad).

At only 2 g of carbs per 2 Tbsp serving, this dressing should be easy to fit within your daily macros. As with any [salad dressing](/salad-dressing), Wish-Bone's Ranch is easy to overeat, so be mindful of your portion sizes to ensure you're staying within your macronutrient limits.

Wish-Bone offers a few varieties of Ranch dressing. Their classic ranch, buffalo ranch, and cheddar bacon all contain roughly identical ingredients and similar macronutrient profiles. The only difference is that the classic ranch has 12 g of fat per serving while buffalo ranch and cheddar bacon each have 13 g. The difference is small enough that you can just choose whichever flavor you like best. Avoid Wish-Bone's "Light" varieties of Ranch dressing, as these have lower fats and higher carbs.
