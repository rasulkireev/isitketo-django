There aren't many freebies on keto, but lettuce is as close as you can get. Available fresh year-round in every grocery store and restaurant, lettuce is a crunchy, hydrating vegetable. Often the base of a salad, lettuce can also replace [bread](/bread) or tortillas as a great way to make wraps. It's easy to make lettuce wrap sandwiches with any large-leaf varieties, such as romaine or butter lettuce.

It's difficult to overeat lettuce. A whole head is only about 5.6 g of net carbs, and eating an entire head of lettuce is an accomplishment in itself. One cup of shredded lettuce contains 1.3 g of net carbs, so this easily fits in your macros. Lettuce contains electrolyte minerals like potassium and sodium, as well as vitamins A and K.

People criticize lettuce for being boring or "just crunchy water." In fact, this is a benefit. Since lettuce contains so much [water](/water), you're hydrating yourself while simultaneously nourishing yourself.

There are numerous varieties of lettuce, and they're all great for keto. A good rule of thumb is that the darker green the leaves, the more nutrients it contains, but even the lightest green types like iceberg or romaine are nutritious and keto-friendly.
