If you have fond memories of enjoying watermelon on a hot summer day, brace yourself for some tough news: watermelons are not keto.

A medium-sized watermelon wedge contains over 20 g of net carbs. That's high enough to interfere with your ketosis even if it's the only food you eat for the day.

There aren't a ton of fruit options on keto, but you do have some keto-friendly choices:

* [Avocados](/avocados)
* [Raspberries](/raspberries)
* [Tomatoes](/tomatoes)
* [Blackberries](/blackberries)
