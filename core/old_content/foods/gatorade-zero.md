Sweet, refreshing, and full of electrolytes, Gatorade is the perfect way to rehydrate after a workout. But the [original formula](/gatorade) is full of [sugar](/sugar) &mdash; impossible for keto adherents to enjoy without exceeding their carb limits. Fortunately, now there's Gatorade Zero, with none of the sugar and all of the electrolytes of the original formula.

It's important to remember the 'zero' in Gatorade Zero refers to sugar. There are still carbs, and there are still calories, but with just 5 calories and 1 g of net carbs in a 20 oz bottle, there aren't very many. The non-sugar carbs come from the drink's natural flavoring.

The artificial sweeteners [sucralose](/sucralose) and [acesulfame potassium](/acesulfame-potassium) give Gatorade Zero its sweet-without-sugar flavor. While some sweeteners can have negative health impacts, more than [100 FDA-reviewed studies](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/additional-information-about-high-intensity-sweeteners-permitted-use-food-united-states) support the safety of these two sweeteners.

Sports drinks love to boast that they're full of electrolytes, but few people really understand what electrolytes are or how they affect the body. Sodium and potassium, Gatorade Zero's two primary electrolytes, are responsible for regulating muscle function. Heavy exercise can drain your electrolytes, leaving your muscles tired, dehydrated, and cramped. After a tough workout or long hike, the quick shot of electrolytes in Gatorade Zero can help you recover.

Although you're less likely to be drinking alcohol on the keto diet, electrolyte depletion is part of what makes hangovers so unpleasant. If you're ever suffering after a night of heavy drinking, Gatorade Zero can help you feel better in a keto-friendly fashion.
