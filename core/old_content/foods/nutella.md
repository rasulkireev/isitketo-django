Nutella has developed a cult following. You either dislike Nutella or you **love** Nutella; there seems to be no middle ground. Fans of this [chocolate](/chocolate) hazelnut spread love it on everything, from pancakes to waffles to crepes. We've heard of some people who even add it to their [scrambled eggs](/eggs) (we're not judging).

Sadly, this chocolatey spread is almost entirely [sugar](/sugar), so it's incompatible with the keto diet. A 2 tablespoon serving contains 21 g of net carbs, a gigantic amount that alone could bust you out of ketosis.

### Alternatives

The most direct replacement for Nutella is a low-carb substitute product called [Nutilight](https://amzn.to/32A31gp). They make their [dark chocolate variety](https://amzn.to/324VwN5) with [erythritol](/erythritol) and [stevia](/stevia), so it's only 1 g of net carbs per 2 tablespoon serving, but their [hazelnut-flavored Nutella-taste-alike](https://amzn.to/32A31gp) is only slightly higher, at 2 g of net carbs.

If you're looking for a topping for your low-carb pancakes, you can also try keto-friendly [maple syrup](/maple-syrup) replacements. Some options include  [Birch Benders Magic Syrup](https://amzn.to/31vCZJD) (2 g of net carbs per 1/4 cup serving) or [Pyure Organic Maple-Flavored Syrup](https://amzn.to/2MNdIGs) (4 g of net carbs per 1/4 cup serving).
