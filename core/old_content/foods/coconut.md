If you were stranded on a desert island and had to stay keto, look for some palm trees because coconuts are a great match for keto. Plus, if you found a palm tree, you'd also have [palm oil](/palm-oil), another keto classic.

Each serving of coconut (1 cup, shredded) contains 5 g of net carbs. That's a sizeable amount, but coconut is still one of the most keto-friendly fruits you can find.

Coconut is a good source of fats, at 26.8 g per serving. The keto diet is all about fats, so any time you can find a high-fat food you enjoy, consider it a win.
