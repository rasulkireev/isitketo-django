Green peas belong to the same carb-rich family as [black beans](/black-beans). They're more keto-friendly than beans, but with 12.7 g of net carbs and 8.2 g of [sugar](/sugar) per 1 cup serving, they aren't free. To avoid going over your daily carb count, consider limiting yourself to half a cup or less.

On top of being more keto-friendly than [beans](/beans), peas are full of vitamins and nutrients. A single serving of peas contains 13% of your daily vitamin C, necessary for building and repairing cell tissue.

Additionally, the antioxidants in peas have [anti-inflammatory properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5055983/) and may [protect against some cancers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15117556).

Keto-friendly pea recipes follow a simple formula: add fat. Make peas the centerpiece of your meal with a [low-carb split pea soup](https://www.atkins.com/recipes/ham-and-split-pea-soup/1439). Or spice up any dish with a side of [creamy pea salad](https://dinnerthendessert.com/creamy-bacon-pea-salad/).
