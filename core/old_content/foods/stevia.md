Stevia is very keto-friendly. You'll find it in many keto dessert recipes. It's generally the most popular keto-friendly sweetener in the keto community.

A naturally-occurring sweetener extracted from the [stevia rebaudiana plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia_rebaudiana), stevia is zero carb, zero calories, and has a glycemic index of zero.

Stevia's only downside is that some people report a negative aftertaste, but you can mitigate this by blending it with another keto-friendly sweetener, such as [erythritol](/erythritol).

Fun fact: People have been using stevia as a sweetener for more than a thousand years. The [Guaran√≠ people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaran%C3%AD_people), indigenous to what is now Paraguay, referred to the plant as "sweet herb" and soaked it in boiling [water](/water) to make tea.
