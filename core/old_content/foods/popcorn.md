As much as we all love popcorn, it's too high in carbs to fit the keto diet.

A 100-calorie pack of popcorn contains 13.8 g of net carbs, so you'll need to pick a different movie snack.

Try a low-carb nut, such as [pecans](/pecans) or brazil nuts. If you want the puffed texture of popcorn without the carbs, consider [pork rinds](/pork-rinds).
