Each serving of lemons (1 fruit, 2-1/8" diameter) contains 3.8 g of net carbs. That's a sizeable amount, but most people don't eat an entire lemon as part of their meal.

You'll often find lemons as part of [keto recipes](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=lemon) for their juice, which is fairly keto-friendly as well.
