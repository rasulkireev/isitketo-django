Pepperoni is big on flavor and low on carbs. Just a few slices of the smoky-spicy meat will liven up any dish. And with 1 g of net carbs in a 3 oz serving, pepperoni is very keto-friendly. The carb counts are low enough to fit into almost any meal.

It's great for adding flavor, but avoid making pepperoni the centerpiece of your meal. The [pork](/pork) and beef scraps used to make it contain a fraction of the vitamins and nutrients found in quality cuts of meat. The only nutrients of note in pepperoni are B vitamins - a typical serving of contains 20% of your daily recommended B12 intake and just 7% of your recommended daily B6 intake. Relative to pork chops or even ground beef, that's pitiful.

Pepperoni [pizza](/pizza) is a classic. To make it keto-friendly, use [cauliflower rice to make a low-carb crust](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q="cauliflower%20pizza"). Or if you want to get creative, mix minced pepperoni with ground beef to create a spicy new burger.
