Although [animal milk](/milk) is frowned-upon in keto due to its high carb content, almond milk is a refreshing, keto-friendly alternative.

Silk almond milk is keto-friendly, as a cup contains fewer than 1 gram of net carbs. Like animal milk, almond milk is an excellent source of calcium. It's also rich in vitamins A, B, D and E. It's a popular ingredient in many keto [baked goods](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q="almond%20milk"&category=dessert) and [smoothies](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=%22almond%20milk%22&category=beverage).

Stick to Silk's unsweetened, vanilla almond milk, as the flavored varieties contain added sugars. Silk's regular vanilla almond milk contains 15 g of [sugar](/sugar), which is not at all keto-friendly.
