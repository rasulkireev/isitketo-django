Wasabi is a spicy vegetable that you're mostly likely to find as a topping for [sushi](/sushi). It's a close relative of [horseradish](/horseradish), which is why some regions refer to it as "Japanese horseradish."

Each serving of wasabi (1 tablespoon) contains 2 g of net carbs. That's a bit on the high side for a condiment, but you can fit in small amounts if you've got a strong hankering for wasabi.

Consider limiting yourself to half a portion per day to avoid going over your carb limits.

Wasabi is a good source of fats, at 0.5 g per serving. The keto diet is all about fats, so any time you can find a high-fat food you enjoy, consider it a win.

### Vitamins and nutrients

Wasabi is a cruciferous vegetable, a family of crop species that includes [kale](/kale) and [broccoli](/broccoli). Scientists are interested in cruciferous vegetables because of evidence that suggests that they [contain compounds that prevent cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cruciferous-vegetables-fact-sheet). More research is needed, but several studies have found that people who consume cruciferous vegetables like wasabi are [less likely to develop lung](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11078758) or [colon cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11117618).

Relative to foods like nuts and leafy greens, wasabi is low in nutrients. Enjoy it in moderation, but don't let your indulgence push out other, healthier carbs.

### Alternatives

If you're a bit of a heat seeker and want a replacement for wasabi that's more keto-friendly, consider [Frank's RedHot Sauce](/franks-redhot-sauce-original). It adds a spicy kick to your food, and it's a zero-carb option.
