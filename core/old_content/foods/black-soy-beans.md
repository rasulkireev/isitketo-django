For keto eaters, restrictions on beans are a crushing blow. Almost every bean variety is loaded with carbs, which eliminates huge parts of Latin American cuisine and American classics like three-bean chili or beans 'n franks. But just when you thought all hope was lost, a bean hero emerges: black soy beans.

Unlike other starchy bean varieties like [lima beans](/lima-beans) or [black beans](/black-beans), black soy beans are delightfully low in carbs, at only 1 g of net carbs per half-cup serving. Not only that, but they contain 6 g of fat and an impressively high 11 g of protein. They're more firm than regular black beans, so a popular way to eat them is to add them to chili or to make [refried beans](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=refried%20black%20soy%20beans).

Within the keto community, [Eden Organic](https://amzn.to/2DZgYK8) is the most popular and frequently recommended brand of black soy beans, though there are some smaller brands like [Handy Pantry](https://amzn.to/2ta9wpf) that sell it as well.
