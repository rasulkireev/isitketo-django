Rice is an integral part of many cuisines worldwide.  It's affordable, easy to cook, and available in every grocery store.  It's an ingredient in many dishes like [sushi](/sushi), rice pudding, and stuffed grape leaves.

Unfortunately, rice isn't compatible with keto.  A single cup of rice contains nearly 45 g of carbs.  One cup is less than what you'd get as a side dish in a Chinese restaurant.  Rice is very easy to overeat, as you can only have a couple of spoonfuls to keep under your carb limit for the day, so it's best to avoid it.

So many dishes feature rice that it can be a challenge to eliminate it from your diet.  A great substitute is riced [cauliflower](/cauliflower).  Buy it whole and grate it yourself or purchase it already grated, or "riced." Cooked cauliflower can replace rice in most dishes since it has such a light flavor.  Another option is [Miracle Rice](https://amzn.to/2FzaK52).  It's a zero-carb rice substitute made from glucomannan, a natural dietary fiber.
