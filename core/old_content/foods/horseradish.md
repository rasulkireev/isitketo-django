Horseradish is a polarizing vegetable. Some enjoy its spicy punch, while others find it too bitter and overwhelming.

Each serving of horseradish (1 tablespoon) contains 1.2 g of net carbs. That means that you can still fit it into your meals, though it's not the most keto-friendly condiment you can find.

### Vitamins and nutrients

Horseradish is a cruciferous vegetable, a family of crop species that includes [kale](/kale) and [broccoli](/broccoli). Scientists are interested in cruciferous vegetables because of evidence that suggests that they [contain compounds that prevent cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cruciferous-vegetables-fact-sheet). More research is needed, but several studies have found that people who consume cruciferous vegetables like horseradish are [less likely to develop lung](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11078758) or [colon cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11117618).

Relative to foods like nuts and leafy greens, horseradish is low in nutrients. Enjoy it in moderation, but don't let your indulgence push out other, healthier carbs.

### Alternatives

If you're a bit of a heat seeker and want a replacement for horseradish that's more keto-friendly, consider [Frank's RedHot Sauce](/franks-redhot-sauce-original). It adds a spicy kick to your food, and it's a zero-carb option.
