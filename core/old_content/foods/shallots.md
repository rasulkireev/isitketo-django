short_answer: While shallots pack some carbs, they're a garnish, so the amount you
  use is so a normal meal includes so little that them fit easily into the keto diet.

Each serving of shallots (1 tbsp chopped) contains 1.4 g of net carbs. If you ate enormous quantities of them, you might find yourself knocked out of ketosis. The normal amount of shallots you'd find in most recipes is so small that the carbs are effectively negligible. Eat them and enjoy!
