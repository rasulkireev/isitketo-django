Ain't it peachy? In the keto world, unfortunately not. As much as you might crave this sweet, fuzzy fruit, peaches are a poor match for the keto diet.

A single, small peach delivers 12.6 g of net carbs, which would be high for an entire meal, let alone a simple snack. And canned peaches? Don't even think about it. They're often stored in [sugary](/sugar) syrup, driving the carb count even higher.

Some [keto recipes use peaches](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=peach) in small amounts as either a topping to a dessert or a feature in a salad

### Alternatives

Unfortunately, only a few [fruits](/category/fruits) have a low enough carb count to fit the keto diet. Berries tend to be your best bet. Here are a few keto-friendly options:

- [Blackberries](/blackberries)
- [Raspberries](/raspberries)
- [Strawberries](/strawberries)
