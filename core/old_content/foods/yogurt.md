Yogurt is a decent dairy keto option. It's low in carbs and high in fat.

Just be careful to avoid flavored yogurts or low-fat yogurts, as these often include non-keto ingredients or drive up the carb count substantially.

If you want an even better option for keto, try [greek yogurt](/greek-yogurt). With fewer carbs, higher fats and proteins, it has similar taste and makes it easier for you to achieve your keto macros.
