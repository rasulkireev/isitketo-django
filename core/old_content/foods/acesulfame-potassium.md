Acesulfame potassium is an artificial sweetener that is 200 times sweeter than [sugar](/sugar). It contains only 0.5 g of net carbs per half-gram serving, so it's a great way to make sweet desserts without packing on the carbs.

This sweetener may sound unfamiliar, but it appears in hundreds of popular products like [Coke Zero](/coke-zero) and Orbit [gum](/gum). Manufacturers sometimes refer to it on the label as "acesulfame K" or "ace-K."

If you have a sweet tooth, acesulfame K is a good alternative for sugar in baked desserts because it remains stable at high temperatures. Acesulfame potassium can be a little bitter, which is why many companies use it with other sweeteners. Similarly, many keto recipes recommend blending ace-K with other sweeteners like [stevia](/stevia), [erythritol](/erythritol), or [xylitol](/xylitol).

There's a debate in the keto community over whether artificial sweeteners like acesulfame potassium are compatible with the keto diet. The FDA stated that ace-K is [safe for consumption](https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm397725.htm), with over 90 studies supporting its safety. Many people consume acesulfame potassium with no negative side effects, but a minority experience sugar cravings and interruptions to ketosis.
