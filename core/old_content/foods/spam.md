Spam may not be classy, but its low carb count might make you view it in a new light.

The Hormel Foods Corporation created Spam in 1937 to sell more pork shoulder, the worst-selling cut of [pork](/pork). Then, during World War II, the U.S. government sent Spam to the troops because it was easier to deliver than fresh meat. After the war, soldiers returned home with a taste for this odd product, and Spam has adorned grocery store shelves ever since.

Canned [ham](/ham) may not be the prettiest protein, but it's good for keto eaters since a 2 oz serving has only 1 g of net carbs. You can eliminate Spam's notoriously slimy texture by frying it for a keto-friendly sandwich or dicing it like [bacon](/bacon) and adding it to [eggs](/eggs).

There are several varieties and flavors of Spam that vary in keto-friendliness. [Classic](https://amzn.to/2MVJ9N7), [Bacon](https://amzn.to/2G9bTBd), [Turkey](https://amzn.to/2WDghxz) and [Hickory Smoke Spam](https://amzn.to/2MOKpkX) are each only 1 g of net carbs per 2 oz serving. [Hot and Spicy](https://amzn.to/2WGTz7B), [Jalapeno](https://amzn.to/2GnwEbN), [Chorizo](https://amzn.to/2GnusB1), and [Black Pepper](https://amzn.to/2MQfRiH) are slightly higher in carbs, at 2 g of net carbs per serving. With 5 g of net carbs, [Teriyaki Spam](https://amzn.to/2TxKwnE) is the highest carb flavor, though this is still relatively keto-friendly.

Finally, consider [Spam Less Sodium](https://amzn.to/2D8wNMR) if you need to reduce your sodium intake but want similar macros to Classic Spam.
