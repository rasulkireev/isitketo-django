Each serving of Zipfizz Energy Shots (4 fl oz) contains 8 g of net carbs. Unfortunately, that's a bit too high to be appropriate for the keto diet.

Zipfizz Energy Shots have 120.0 mg of caffeine. A [2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28177691) found that people who consumed between 2.5 and 5.0 mg of caffeine per kg of body weight raised their blood ketone levels between 88% and 116%. Caffeine has also been shown to boost metabolism, enhance short-term energy levels, and help with fat loss.

### Alternatives

For an energy supplement that fits better with the keto diet, consider [5-Hour Energy Shots](/5-hour-energy-shots). At zero net carbs, they provide a similar energy boost to Zipfizz Energy Shots without interfering with your ketosis. And, of course, you can always drink [black coffee](/coffee), the original zero carb energy drink.
