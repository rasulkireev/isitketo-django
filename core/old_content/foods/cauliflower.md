Keto bloggers love to write about cauliflower because it's a great replacement for beloved carbs like [rice](/rice), [potatoes](/potatoes), and pasta. The Centers for Disease Control even [classified cauliflower as a powerhouse vegetable](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/13_0390.htm).

Cauliflower has 3 g of net carbs per 1 cup serving and is high in fiber, vitamin C, and choline. Choline is an essential nutrient that most people lack in their diets, and adequate intake [reduces the risk of liver disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320186?dopt=Abstract) and [dementia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12917896?dopt=Abstract). Be aware that you'll lose most of cauliflower's nutritional value if you boil it. Instead, steam or stir-fry it.

Substitute cauliflower for carbs in popular keto recipes like ["mac" and cheese](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=%22mac%20and%20cheese%22%20cauliflower), [pizza](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=pizza%20cauliflower), and [mashed cauliflower](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=%22mashed%20cauliflower%22). For a simple snack, eat raw cauliflower with a keto-friendly dip. Or, try one of two popular ways to cook cauliflower as a side dish. One is called "ricing" the cauliflower, where you put the raw florets in a food processor, grate it on a cheese grater, or buy it already riced. Then, you cook the "rice" by steaming, pan-frying, or roasting it. The second method is to steam frozen or fresh cauliflower on the stovetop or in the microwave.

Cooked cauliflower has a strong odor, so it may make your home a bit smelly. Those prone to bloating or gas may experience an additional type of odor, as the body produces extra gas when it digests cauliflower.
