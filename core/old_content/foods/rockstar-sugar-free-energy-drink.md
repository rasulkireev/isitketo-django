If you rely on energy drinks to stay focused during the day, fear not â€” Rockstar sells a keto-friendly version of its original flavor! An 8 oz serving of Rockstar's Sugar-Free Energy Drink has 0 g of net carbs. It has the same taste as regular Rockstar, but it contains [sucralose](/sucralose) and [acesulfame potassium](/acesulfame-potassium) instead of [sugar.](/sugar)

There's still a debate in the keto community about adding artificial sweeteners to your diet. The FDA stated that both sucralose and acesulfame potassium are [safe for consumption](https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm397725.htm) with support from more than 90 studies. However, these artificial sweeteners can interfere with ketosis for a minority of consumers. If you're unsure of how these sweeteners affect you, try Rockstar in small amounts and monitor for changes in your weight or interference with your ketosis.

Caffeine in drinks like Rockstar can improve your cognitive performance, but be careful not to overconsume it. A recent meta-study found that drinking multiple energy drinks each day can have [adverse effects on your heart, blood pressure, and quality of sleep](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00225/full).
