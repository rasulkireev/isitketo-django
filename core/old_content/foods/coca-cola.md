Are you considering a refreshing Coca-Cola with your bunless burger?  Unfortunately, one 12 oz can of Coke contains [39 g of carbohydrates](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/45375047?fgcd=&manu=&format=&count=&max=25&offset=&sort=default&order=asc&qlookup=Coca-Cola+Can%2C+12+fl+oz%2C+PREPARED%2C+GTIN%3A+00049000006346&ds=&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=), and they're nearly all from high-fructose corn syrup.

High-fructose corn syrup is one of the top ingredients to avoid when you're keto.  There are [plenty of reasons](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/ingredients-to-avoid) high-fructose corn syrup is an unhealthy choice.  One of the biggest reasons is that it can spike your blood sugar dramatically, kicking you out of ketosis.

Coca-Cola, as a carb-heavy soda, is one of the first things to eliminate from your daily intake when choosing to go keto.  All of the carbs in a regular Coke are from [sugar](/sugar), not from fiber or sugar alcohols, and it contains virtually no nutrients that would offset the high carbohydrate content.

If you absolutely must have regular Coca-Cola, drink it in very small amounts. 6 ounces is enough to exhaust your entire carb count for the day.

There are other options to satisfy your soda craving.  The easiest is a diet soda that uses a keto-friendly sweetener.  [Diet Coke](/diet-coke) is an exceptionally popular choice, and most people have no trouble staying in ketosis having this as an occasional drink.  You can also grab flavored soda waters that have no sweetener in them.

You can even get creative with your own sodas using [carbonated water](/seltzer) and keto-friendly syrups crafted in your kitchen.  (Pro tip!  Soda with [erythritol](/erythritol), vanilla extract, and a dash of [heavy whipping cream](/heavy-whipping-cream) makes the best cream soda you've ever had.)
