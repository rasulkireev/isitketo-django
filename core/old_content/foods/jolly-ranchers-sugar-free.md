Jolly Ranchers Sugar-Free have zero net carbs, though they're sadly still not keto. They contain [isomalt](/isomalt) and [polyglycitol syrup](/polyglycitol-syrup), both of which are non-keto sweeteners.

### Alternatives

When it comes to keto-friendly hard candies, the options are pretty thin. Virtually every low-carb or low-sugar candy achieves its low carb count through non-keto sweeteners, like [maltitol](/maltitol) or sorbitol.

One notable exception is [Dr. John's Healthy Sweets Sugar-Free Fruit Hard Candy](https://amzn.to/2ATyn86). Dr. John's uses only keto-friendly sweeteners: [erythritol](/erythritol), [xylitol](/xylitol), and [stevia](/stevia). Best of all, they're only 1 g of net carbs per serving.

Venturing a bit outside candies, [dark chocolate](/dark-chocolate) is a classic keto sweet. Varieties that are 80% cacao or higher tend to run between 4 to 6 g of net carbs per serving. Specialty brands like [Lily's Chocolate](/lilys-chocolate) sweeten their chocolate with [erythritol](/erythritol), making it even easier to eat on keto.
