Coffee-Mate's Sugar-Free Creamy Chocolate coffee creamer is appealing. Each serving contains only 30 calories and 2 g of net carbs.

This creamer uses [sucralose](/sucralose) and [acesulfame potassium](/acesulfame-potassium) as sweeteners. Both are keto-friendly sweeteners, but sucralose can interfere with ketosis for a minority of people. You may choose to experiment with this creamer, but if you find yourself falling out of ketosis, this creamer is the likely culprit.

For an even more keto-friendly way to flavor your coffee, consider keto classics such as heavy cream or [stevia](/stevia).
