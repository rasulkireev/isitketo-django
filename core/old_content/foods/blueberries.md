Blueberries have several health benefits, as they are high in antioxidants and vitamin C. Unfortunately, they are one of the most carb-heavy berries. A sinle cup serving of blueberries contains 18 g of net carbs.

Blueberries are okay in small amounts, but when possible, eat lower-carb berries such as [blackberries](/blackberries) or [raspberries](/raspberries).
