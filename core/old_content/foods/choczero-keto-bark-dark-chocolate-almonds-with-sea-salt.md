In general, [dark chocolate](/dark-chocolate) is one of the more keto-friendly sweets. ChocZero takes it a step further with their almond keto bark. They sweeten these candies using natural [monk fruit](/monk-fruit) extract, a very keto sweetener. All the ingredients are organic and sugar-free.

The result is a keto snack that's only 2 g of net carbs per serving. Fans say that it's a perfect replacement for traditional chocolate. Many even say it tastes better than its non-keto alternatives.
