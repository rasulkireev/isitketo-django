One small onion contains 5.3 g of net carbs. Fortunately, few people are tempted to eat an entire onion in one sitting.

People typically eat small amounts of onion in their meals. Perhaps you want a few slices of onions to accompany your [steak](/steak). Each medium onion slice is around 1 g of net carbs, so it's doable, but not free.

Onions are a tremendously popular [ingredient in keto recipes](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=onion). Onions are great for keto cooking because a small amount adds lots of flavor. You can often add a half or whole onion to a multi-serving recipe without bloating the number of carbs in each serving.
