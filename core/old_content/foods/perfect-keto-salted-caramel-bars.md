Have you ever drank a protein shake and thought, "this is delicious, but I wish I had the option to eat it?" If so, you're in luck. Perfect Keto's [salted caramel bars](https://shop.perfectketo.com/products/keto-bars?rfsn=3090853.a1307b&utm_source=Refersion&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_campaign=3090853&variant=16045811269703) are a cross between a protein shake and a granola bar, delivering 11 g of protein in a snackable, ready-to-eat bar.

With 18 g of [healthy fats](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/monounsaturated-fats) and plenty of protein, Perfect Keto's salted caramel bars are sure to fill you up. And with just 2 g of net carbs, it's easy to fit a bar (or two!) into your daily carb limits.

Perfect Keto bars get their sweet, caramel flavor from [stevia](/stevia), a natural carb-free sweetener. The bars also contain 1 g of added [sugar](/sugar), but that shouldn't be a problem &mdash; unless you eat the entire box in one sitting.
