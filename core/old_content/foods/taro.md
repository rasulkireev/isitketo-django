Each serving of taro (1 cup, sliced) contains 23.3 g of net carbs. Sadly, that's far too carb-heavy to fit the keto diet.

As a general rule, root vegetables rarely fit the keto diet. They're often too starchy, unlike leafy green veggies, which are mostly keto-friendly.

### Alternatives

For a lower carb root vegetable, consider the [radish](/radishes). At only 2.1 g of net carbs per serving, radishes certainly leave taro in the dust.
