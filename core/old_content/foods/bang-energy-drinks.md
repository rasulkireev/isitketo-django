Nutritionally, Bang is similar to other low-carb energy drinks such as [Rockstar Sugar-Free](/rockstar-sugar-free-energy-drink) and [Monster Ultra](/monster-energy-drink-ultra). It achieves a sweet taste with zero carbs because its sweeteners are [sucralose](/sucralose) and [acesulfame potassium](/acesulfame-potassium), both of which are keto-friendly. It also contains 300 mg of caffeine (roughly two cups of [coffee](/coffee)), which can [aid in ketosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28177691).

Bang's flagship ingredient is Creatyl-L-Leucine, which they refer to as "Super Creatine." Creatine is a popular supplement among weightlifters, as it helps muscles recover energy more quickly, though there's not much research available on *super* creatine. Opponents claim that Bang does not contain creatine at all, and that the label is misleading consumers (see below).

### Allegations of false advertising

As of 2019, Bang is currently the subject of two lawsuits for false advertising. The first is a [class-action lawsuit](https://www.truthinadvertising.org/bang-energy-drinks-2/) from consumers, and the [second](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-monster-energy-bang-lawsuit-20190403-story.html) is from Bang's competitor, Monster.

Both lawsuits allege that:

* Bang contains Creatyl-L-Leucine ("Super Creatine"), branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and coenzyme Q10 in such small quantities that it has no effect on performance.
* Vital Pharmaceuticals (aka VPX), Bang's manufacturer, uses the term "pharmaceuticals" in their company name to mislead customers into believing that they are a pharmaceuticals company rather than a beverage manufacturer.
* The company claimed without evidence that Bang is an effective treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, and other forms of dementia.

### Caveats

The keto community continues to debate whether artificial sweeteners have a place in the keto diet. The FDA stated that both sucralose and acesulfame potassium are [safe for consumption](https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm397725.htm) with support from more than 90 studies. However, these artificial sweeteners can interfere with ketosis for a minority of consumers. If you're unsure of how these sweeteners affect you, try Bang in small amounts and monitor for changes in your weight or interference with your ketosis.

Caffeine in drinks like Bang can improve your cognitive performance, but be careful not to overconsume it. A recent meta-study found that drinking multiple energy drinks each day can have [adverse effects on your heart, blood pressure, and quality of sleep](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00225/full).
