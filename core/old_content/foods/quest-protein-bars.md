Birthday Cake, Rocky Road, and S'Mores, oh my! These decadent flavors of Quest Bars have only 4 g of net carbs. Try one for a boost of protein or for a guilt-free treat.

Quest Bars are popular among athletes and weightlifters. At 16 to 21 g of protein per bar, they're great for building muscle. These bars are so delicious and have such good macros that you'll be tempted to eat them all day. Just be mindful of their substantial fiber content, at 14 g per bar. While the fiber helps you feel full longer, it can also cause unpleasant side effects like gas or bloating if you eat too many bars in a day.

As if its flavors weren't fun enough, Quest also shares keto-friendly recipes that use the protein bars as ingredients, like [birthday cake](http://blog.questnutrition.com/this-is-the-last-birthday-cake-recipe-youll-need-for-the-protein-lover-in-your-life/) and [mocha cupcakes](http://blog.questnutrition.com/make-the-most-of-your-mocha-chocolate-chip-quest-bar-with-these-mocha-cupcakes/). They're sure to be crowd-pleasers among keto and non-keto eaters alike.
