Add a small amount of raspberries to your weekly menu to satisfy your sweet tooth!

One cup of fresh raspberries has about 7 g of net carbs. That's a sizable amount, though raspberries are one of the most keto-friendly fruits. They're also rich in vitamin A, vitamin C, and folate. Although you can get similar nutrients from grass-fed meats and non-starchy vegetables, sometimes you just need a little bit of fruit in your life. In addition, research shows that raspberries [reduce inflammation and strengthen your immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4717884/).

Fresh raspberries are a great snack on their own, but they're also a popular addition to many delicious keto desserts like [cheesecake](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org?q=raspberry%20cheesecake) and [ice cream](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=raspberry%20%22ice%20cream%22).

Although fresh raspberries are keto-friendly, dried raspberries and raspberry juice are not. They contain hidden sugars and fewer nutrients than fresh raspberries, so it's best to avoid them altogether.
