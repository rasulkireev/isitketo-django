Baked goods are one of the biggest challenges for keto. Most standard baking recipes are high in [sugar](/sugar) and wheat flour, both of which are big no-nos on keto.

Fat Snax achieves great taste and low carb by using [almond](/almond-flour) and [coconut flour](/coconut-flour) instead of wheat. All of its cookies are sugar free, as Fat Snax uses keto-friendly sugar substitutes like [erythritol](/erythritol), [xanthan gum](/xanthan-gum), and [stevia](/stevia). The nutritional profile varies slightly depending on the flavor, with [peanut butter](/peanut-butter) and lemony lemon offering 1 g of net carbs per cookie, while chocolate chip and double chocolate chip weigh in at 2 g of net carbs. These cookies are also a good source of fat, at 8 - 9 g per cookie.

They're not as sweet as traditional cookies, like [Nestle Tollhouse](https://amzn.to/2T2oxcg), but Fat Snax cookies are a keto-friendly way to satisfy those old cookie cravings.
