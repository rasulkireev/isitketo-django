Eggs are a very popular keto food, present in most [keto breakfast recipes](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?category=breakfast). They're a great source of protein and fat, while remaining low in carbs. One large egg contains only 0.4 g of net carbs.

Eggs are so keto-friendly, in fact, that "egg fasts" are a popular trend in the keto community for breaking stalls in weight loss. An egg fast is when a person eats only eggs, healthy fats ([butter](/butter), [olive oil](/olive-oil), coconut oil), and [cheese](/cheese) for 3-5 days. It's not for everybody...
