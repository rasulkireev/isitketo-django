This product may advertise reduced sugar, but it's still almost entirely carbs. It contains no fiber, no protein, and no fat.

While 4 g of net carbs is a relatively small portion of your daily limit, it's very high for a condiment. Consider more keto-friendly ketchups such as [Heinz's No Sugar Added](/heinz-tomato-ketchup-no-sugar-added) variety.
