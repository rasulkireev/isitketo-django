A 2 tablespoon serving of classic hummus contains only 4.2 g of net carbs, making it a keto-friendly dip.

Not all hummus is created equally, however. Different brands use different ingredients in their hummus; some varieties can reach up to 10 g of net carbs. Check the nutrition label and choose a keto-friendly brand. [Sabra's Classic Hummus](https://sabra.com/dips/hummus/classic-hummus.html) is a trusted favorite.

The carbs in hummus mainly come from chickpeas, which are high in carbs, but do have a low glycemic index, so it doesn't have a large impact on insulin levels. Hummus' other ingredients are all keto-friendly and contain valuable nutrients for someone on a keto diet.

Although you may be tempted to have it with pita bread, prefer keto-friendly foods to dip in it, such as [celery](/celery) or [cucumber](/cucumbers).
