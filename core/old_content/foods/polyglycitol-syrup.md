Polyglycitol syrup is a type of hydogenated starch hydrolysate (HSH) syrup. It's a mix of [maltitol](/maltitol) and sorbitol, both of which are non-keto sweeteners.

Polyglycitol syrup has [a glycemic index of 39](http://www.mendosa.com/netcarbs.htm), meaning that it will spike your blood sugar and interfere with ketosis.

## Safety

Safety is a concern with any artificial sweetener. There's fierce debate over the safety of many [sugar](/sugar) substitutes. Eliminating sugar is great, but nobody wants a replacement that's going to cause health complications.

A [2009 review](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1413) by the European Food Safety Authority found no significant safety concerns with Polyglycitol syrup.

## Gastrointestinal issues

The European Food Safety Authority found that as little as 1 g of polyglycitol syrup can cause [gastrointestinal distress](http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v20je14.htm). Large quantities can have a laxative effect, so make sure you have easy access to a bathroom if you decide to eat a ton of candy with polyglycitol syrup.

## Alternatives

For a more natural alternative, consider [stevia](/stevia) or [monk fruit](/monk-fruit). Both are all-natural and have nearly zero effect on blood sugar.

Other popular keto-friendly sweeteners include [erythritol](/erythritol) and [xylitol](/xylitol). They're sugar alcohols, which humans can't digest, so you get the sweetness without the carbs.
