Each serving of cranberries (1 cup, chopped) contains 9.2 g of net carbs. That's on the high side, but you can still squeeze in small amounts if you've got a strong craving for this tasty fruit.

Consider limiting yourself to half a portion per day to avoid going over your carb limits.

Though fresh cranberries fit the keto diet, canned or dried cranberries do not. Packaged cranberries contain tons of added [sugar](/sugar) that manufacturers use as a preservative.

### Vitamins and nutrients

Cranberries contain 17% of your [daily value of vitamin C](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/), an essential antioxidant that [can help prevent cardiovascular disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17884994).
