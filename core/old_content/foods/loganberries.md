manual_intro: Loganberries are a hybrid between North American blackberries and European
  raspberries. Their name comes from [James Harvey Logan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harvey_Logan),
  an amateur botanist who actually [created these berries by mistake](https://oregon-berries.com/history/)
  by planting his blackberries too close to a raspberry vine. Strangely, the loganberry
  is much higher in carbs than either of its ancestors.

Loganberries are a hybrid between North American blackberries and European raspberries. Their name comes from [James Harvey Logan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harvey_Logan), an amateur botanist who actually [created these berries by mistake](https://oregon-berries.com/history/) by planting his blackberries too close to a raspberry vine. Strangely, the loganberry is much higher in carbs than either of its ancestors.

Each serving of loganberries (1 cup) contains 11.1 g of net carbs. Unfortunately, that's a bit too high to be appropriate for the keto diet.

### Alternatives

Unfortunately, only a few [fruits](/category/fruits) have a low enough carb count to fit the keto diet. If you're dying for some fruit, berries tend to be your best bet. Here are a few keto-friendly options:

- [Blackberries](/blackberries)
- [Raspberries](/raspberries)
- [Strawberries](/strawberries)

Although it may not spring to mind when you think "fruit," [avocados](/avocados) are the most keto-friendly fruit you can find. They're high in healthy fats and have a low carb profile, making them ideal for keto.
