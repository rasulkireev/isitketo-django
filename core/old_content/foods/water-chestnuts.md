Each serving of water chestnuts (1 cup) contains 24.2 g of net carbs. Sadly, that's far too carb-heavy to fit the keto diet.

### Alternatives

For a vegetable with a similar crunch, try [daikon radishes](/daikon-radishes). At only 2.7 g of net carbs per serving, they're a far less starchy vegetable than water chestnuts

Also consider the delicious [jicama](/jicama). One of the few keto-friendly root vegetables, jicama are a similarly textured vegetable with a far lower carb count.
