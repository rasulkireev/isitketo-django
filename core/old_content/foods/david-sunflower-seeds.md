David sunflower seeds are a great snack when you've got a food craving between meals but don't want to take in too many carbs. They're a nice, fatty seed, and they're rich in vitamin E, which is critical to proper brain function. Each 1.625 oz single-serving bag of David sunflower seeds contains only 2 g of net carbs and 12 of fat.

Stick with David's original varieties of sunflower seeds, as David's flavored varieties of sunflower seeds contain [sugar](/sugar) and are not keto-friendly.

Like any keto snack, pay careful attention to your portion size. A single 1.625 oz package of sunflower seeds fits safely within your daily macros, but it can be easy to go overboard if you begin absent-mindedly snacking from a large bag.

If you've never eaten sunflower seeds, the process is a bit unintuitive. Check out [this wikiHow](https://wikihow.com/Eat-Sunflower-Seeds) for a visual guide to eating sunflower seeds.
