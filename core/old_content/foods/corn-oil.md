Corn oil is a processed polyunsaturated fat. This is one of the "bad fats" you should avoid on keto.

The processing required to produce corn oil adds free radicals and artificial trans fats, both of which are harmful to your health.

Prefer other keto-friendly options such as coconut oil, [extra virgin olive oil](/olive-oil), or [palm oil](/palm-oil).
