Pyure is a blend of [stevia](/stevia) and [erythritol](/erythritol), both of which are keto-friendly.

Be sure to use the "all-purpose blend" of Pyure. Pyure sells a "bakeable blend" that contains maltodextrin, which is not keto-friendly.

The label notes 2 g of carbs, but these are entirely from erythritol. These do not count against your daily carb count, as erythritol is a sugar alcohol, so the body does not absorb it during digestion.
