Salami's distinctive salty and acidic flavor comes from the curing process, in which [pork](/pork) is dried with a mixture of vinegar, salt, and spices. The traditional recipe contains no carbs, but major salami producers often augment their recipe with [sugar](/sugar). You're more likely to find keto-friendly salami at a standalone deli, as salami at the grocery store is often contains added sugar.

Even with added sugar, salami is rarely a high-carb food. Most processed salami contains less than 1 g of net carbs per slice. Enjoy it, but don't go nuts. You want to save your carbs for nutrient-dense vegetables.

With 38 g of fat per serving, salami makes a perfect afternoon snack. Pair it with [cheese](/cheese) - pecorino and provolone go nicely - and you're sure to stay full until dinner.
