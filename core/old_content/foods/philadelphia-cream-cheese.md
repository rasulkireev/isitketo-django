Cream cheese is an excellent source of fats, and Philadelphia is one of the most widely recognized cream cheese brands. A 2 tbsp serving contains only 2 g of net carbs but packs 7 g of fat. For a low-carb, high-fat diet like keto, those are excellent macros.

This delicious spread is incredibly versatile. You can use it as a spread on keto-friendly crackers or dip some [celery](/celery) into it. It's also great for keto baking, as it appears in tons of [keto dessert recipes](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=%22cream%20cheese%22&category=dessert). It's a classic in [keto cheesecake](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=%22cream%20cheese%22%20cheesecake&category=dessert), but try it in [keto brownies](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=%22cream%20cheese%22%20brownies&category=dessert) or in some [fat bombs](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=%22cream%20cheese%22%20fat%20bomb&category=dessert).

Be sure to avoid the flavored cream cheese variants like strawberry and blueberry, as they add high-carb sugars to achieve the flavorings. Stick with original, plain cream cheese or whipped cream cheese.
