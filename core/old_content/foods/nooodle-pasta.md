If you love Italian cuisine, pasta can be one of the hardest foods to give up on a low carb diet. Regular pasta noodles are made from wheat flour, so they're incredibly heavy on the carbs. A single serving of traditional pasta can have upwards of 40 g of net carbs. And that's before you even add in the sauce!

Fortunately, NOoodle is a keto-friendly alternative to traditional pasta noodles. NOoodle is a brand of [shirataki noodles](/shirataki-noodles), a zero-carb pasta noodle popular in Asia. It's gluten-free, nearly zero net carbs, and zero calories.

### Glucomannan

NOoodle is made from glucomannan, a fiber that comes from the konjac plant. Humans can't digest this fiber, which is why NOoodle has such a low carb and calorie count.

Glucomannan is a fascinating substance, as it can absorb [50 times its weight in water](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892933/). This property makes it helpful for weight loss, as the expansion of glucomannan in your stomach helps you feel full longer. A [2005 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15614200/) found that overweight people who consumed glucomannan on a regular basis lost an average of 9 lbs over a 5-week period with no other lifestyle changes.

### Cooking with NOoodle

NOoodle has a mild flavor, so if you're using it as a replacement for wheat pasta, you'll need bold sauces or flavorings to bring a little personality to your dish.

One benefit of NOoodle is how friendly it is to leftovers. While rice noodles can develop a clumpy consistency if you don't eat them fresh, NOoodle preserves well. If you refrigerate and later reheat it, it pretty much maintains the same texture and taste as if it were freshly cooked.
