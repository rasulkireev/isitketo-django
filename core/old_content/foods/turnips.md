Although most root vegetables are forbidden on keto, turnips are one of the few exceptions. Many keto eaters turn to turnips to satisfy their old cravings for [potatoes](/potatoes) without taking on all the carbs.

At 6 g of net carbs per 1 cup serving, turnips can fit comfortably within your daily carb limits. You can find plenty of [keto turnip recipes](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=turnip) for anything from faux mashed potatoes to vegetable soup.

For an even lower carb root vegetable, consider the [radish](/radishes). At only 1.8 g of net carbs per serving, radishes certainly give turnips a run for their money.
