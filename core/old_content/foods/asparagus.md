Farmers market shoppers know that seeing asparagus in the stalls is a sure sign of spring. Green is the most common variety, but you can opt for the fancier white asparagus or enjoy smaller purple asparagus. With just 2.4 g of net carbs per 1 cup serving, it's easy to fit within your daily carb limits. Asparagus also has tons of fiber, potassium, folic acid, and vitamins A, B6, and C. And not that it matters, but some say asparagus is an aphrodisiac.

You can prepare this crisp, crunchy vegetable countless ways. Try it steamed, roasted, or saut√©ed. Shaved thin, asparagus is also delicious in salads. But if you're pressed for time and need something quick, you can even steam a few stalks in the microwave.
