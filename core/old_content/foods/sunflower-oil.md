As a refined fat, sunflower oil is one of the "bad fats" you should avoid on keto.

The processing required to produce sunflower oil adds free radicals, which are harmful to your health.

Instead of sunflower oil, look for keto-friendly options such as coconut oil, [extra virgin olive oil](/olive-oil), or [palm oil](/palm-oil).
