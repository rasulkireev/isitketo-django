The Monster Beverage Company launched in 2002 and has expanded its brand to offer more than 30 varieties of energy drink. The company is known for its association with extreme sports such as BMX biking and mixed-martial arts fights.

Monster's signature original green flavor of energy drinks are far from keto. Each 16 oz can contains 56 g of net carbs, most of which is just [sugar](/sugar). While the drink is a good source of vitamins like B6 and B12, the carb count is far too high to fit into a keto diet. If you're a die-hard fan of Monster, there are fortunately some more keto-friendly varieties available.

### Lower-carb Monster varieties

Monster has many different low-carb flavors, many of which have confusingly similar names. The "Ultra" varieties of Monster are its most keto-friendly, as they're sweetened with [erythritol](/erythritol), which brings their net carbs down to 2 g per can. Ironically, [Monster Lo-Carb Energy Drink](https://amzn.to/2HkR6K1) contains the most carbs of any drink in this list.
