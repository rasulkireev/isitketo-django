A cup of black coffee contains only 2 calories and nearly zero protein, fats, or carbohydrates.

A [2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28177691) found that people who consumed between 2.5 and 5.0 mg of caffeine per kg of body weight raised their blood ketone levels between 88% and 116%. Caffeine has also been shown to boost metabolism, enhance short-term energy levels, and help with fat loss.

The key to keeping your coffee keto-friendly is to be smart about what you add to the cup. Avoid [whole milk](/milk), which is high in carbohydrates. Instead, try a tablespoon of heavy cream. Instead of [sugar](/sugar), try keto-friendly alternatives like [stevia](/stevia) or [erythritol](/erythritol).
