Each serving of cottage cheese (4 oz) contains 3.8 g of net carbs. The carb count is relatively high, but in small amounts, it can be a great complement to keto snacks as a dip or spread.

Stick to plain, full-fat cottage cheese. 2% or low-fat varieties are acceptable but not ideal. Avoid flavored cottage cheese as the flavoring agents often pack extra cabs.

Cottage cheese is a good source of fats, at 4.9 g per serving. The keto diet is all about fats, so any time you can find a high-fat food you enjoy, consider it a win.

Cottage cheese is also a good source of protein, at 12.6 g per serving.

### Vitamins and nutrients

Cottage cheese contains 20% of your [daily value of vitamin B12](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/), which may reduce your risk of [anemia](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vitamin-b12-deficiency-anemia) and [osteoperosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15619681).

Relative to foods like nuts and leafy greens, cottage cheese is low in nutrients. Enjoy it in moderation, but don't let your indulgence push out other, healthier carbs.

### Alternatives

If you're craving a keto dairy spread, consider [cream cheese](/cream-cheese) or [sour cream](/sour-cream). Both foods have the high-fat, low-carb macros that keto dieters crave.
