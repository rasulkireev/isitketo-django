Isomalt is a [sugar](/sugar) substitute that often appears in sugar-free candies and snacks. It's keto-friendly in that it has a [very low glycemic index](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081005965216259), which means that it won't spike your blood sugar and interfere with your ketosis.

## Safety

Safety is a concern with any artificial sweetener. There's fierce debate over the safety of many sugar substitutes. Eliminating sugar is great, but nobody wants a replacement that's going to cause health complications.

More than 80 countries allow [isomalt](https://polyols.org/learn-the-label/isomalt/) in food products, including the US, the EU, Japan, and Australia.

The World Health Organization's Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) [evaluated isomalt in 1985](https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/chemical.aspx?chemID=1289) and placed it into its safest food category.

## Gastrointestinal issues

Some studies have found isomalt is [associated with gastrointestinal distress](http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v20je14.htm), such as flatulence and diarrhea. The digestive issues seem to only occur when you eat more than 20 g of isomalt in a day, and only \~25% experience this, but it's definitely worth caution.

If you find that isomalt doesn't upset your stomach, you can stick with it as a keto-safe replacement for sugary foods. But if you feel an upset tummy after eating foods with isomalt, it's time to find a new sweetener.

## Alternatives

For a more natural alternative, consider [stevia](/stevia) or [monk fruit](/monk-fruit). Both are all-natural and have nearly zero effect on blood sugar.

Other popular keto-friendly sweeteners include [erythritol](/erythritol) and [xylitol](/xylitol). They're sugar alcohols, which humans can't digest, so you get the sweetness without the carbs.
