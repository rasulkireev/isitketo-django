Most sushi is not keto because it contains [rice](/rice), which is high in carbs. If you're dining at a restaurant willing to replace the rice for you, sushi can be keto-friendly. You can replace the rice with [cucumber](/cucumbers) slices (known as "naruto style") or with [cauliflower](/cauliflower) rice.

When eating sushi, be sure to avoid imitation crab meat, as it is extremely high in carbs.

Sashimi is a nice keto-friendly sushi alternative, as it contains no rice.
