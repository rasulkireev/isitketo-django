Sunflower seeds are a great snack when you've got a food craving between meals but don't want to take in too many carbs. With just 6.4 g of net carbs in a 1/3-cup serving, they're easy to fit into your keto diet. At 1 g of fat, they'll keep you satiated until your next meal.

Sunflower seeds are full of vitamins and minerals. A single serving contains 37% of your daily recommended intake of vitamin E, which is critical to proper brain function. Sunflower seeds are also a significant source of copper, which is necessary for red blood cell production, and vitamin B6, which promotes cardiovascular health.

Sunflower seeds are a great alternative to salty, carb-heavy snacks like potato chips. But while they are keto-friendly, they aren't carb-free. Like any keto snack, pay careful attention to your portion size. A single 50 g package of sunflower seeds fits safely within your daily macros, but it can be easy to go overboard if you begin absent-mindedly snacking from a large bag.

If you've never eaten sunflower seeds, the process is a bit unintuitive. Check out [this wikiHow](https://wikihow.com/Eat-Sunflower-Seeds) for a visual guide to eating sunflower seeds.

Sunflower seeds come in many varieties. It doesn't matter if the seeds are salted or roasted, as they're keto-friendly either way. Avoid flavored varieties of sunflower seeds, such as BBQ or ranch, as these usually contain extra [sugar](/sugar).
