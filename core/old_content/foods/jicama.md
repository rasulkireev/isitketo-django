The jicama is a root vegetable native to Mexico. It's otherwise known as "Mexican yam bean" or "Mexican turnip."

Although most root vegetables are forbidden on keto, jicama is one of the few exceptions. Many keto eaters turn to jicama or [turnips](/turnips) to satisfy their old cravings for [potatoes](/potatoes) without taking on all the carbs.

Many describe the jicama a superfood due to its high nutrient and vitamin content. A 1-cup serving of jicama contains only 5.1 g of net carbs, which fits comfortably in most keto eaters' carb limits.
