Endive is a nutrient-rich leafy green, often used in salads. When you eat it raw, it has a crisp, bitter taste. Cooking endive softens the flavor and makes it a bit sweeter.

Each serving of endive (0.5 cup, chopped) contains 0.1 g of net carbs. At only 4 calories per serving, it's not very substantial, but you can rest assured that endive won't interfere with your ketosis.
