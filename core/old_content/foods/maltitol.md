Maltitol is a sugar alcohol that appears in many products that advertise themselves as sugar-free, such as [Russel Stover Sugar-Free Chocolate](/russell-stover-sugar-free-chocolate-candy).

The glycemic index of maltitol is 36, which means that it significantly raises your blood sugar level. For comparison, sucrose (table sugar) has a glycemic index of 65, so maltitol isn't much better than normal sugar.

Avoid products that contain maltitol even if the label lists a low carb count, as the high glycemic index can boot you out of ketosis.

## Alternatives

For a keto-friendly alternative, consider [stevia](/stevia) or [monk fruit](/monk-fruit). Both are all-natural and have nearly zero effect on blood sugar.

Other popular keto-friendly sweeteners include [erythritol](/erythritol) and [xylitol](/xylitol). They're sugar alcohols, which humans can't digest, so you get the sweetness without the carbs.
