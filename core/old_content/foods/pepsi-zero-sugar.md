Formerly known as Pepsi Max, Pepsi Zero Sugar is Pepsi's answer to [Coke Zero](/coke-zero). It has the same taste as regular Pepsi but has zero calories and zero sugar.

Each serving of Pepsi Zero Sugar (12 fl oz) contains 0.2 g of net carbs. That makes it an ideal choice when you want to enjoy the taste of soda without breaking your ketosis.

One of the biggest challenges of a keto diet is staying properly hydrated. It's fine to mix in a bit of soda for taste, but the best way to hydrate is by drinking plenty of [water](/water).

### Sweeteners

The primary sweetener in Pepsi Zero Sugar is [aspartame](/aspartame), a sweetener that has attracted more controversy in the last twenty years than almost any other food product. A [2006 animal study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16507461) initially launched the debate over aspartame, as it suggested that aspartame increases the risk of cancer. That study was [widely panned](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1797853/), and subsequent analyses, including one by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), [found no link](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/131210) between cancer and normal aspartame consumption.

Pepsi Zero Sugar also contains [acesulfame potassium](/acesulfame-potassium), sometimes known as "Ace-K". Acesulfame potassium is an unpopular ingredient in the keto community, though more than [100 FDA-reviewed studies](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/additional-information-about-high-intensity-sweeteners-permitted-use-food-united-states) support its safety.

A small number of people have found that artificial sweeteners can interfere with their ketosis. If you're not sure whether your body reacts negatively to artificial sweeteners, experiment with Pepsi Zero Sugar in small portions before integrating it into your normal diet.

### Alternatives

For a soda without artificial sweeteners, consider [Zevia](/zevia-soda). It's sweetened with [stevia](/stevia), a natural, keto-friendly sweetener that does not increase blood sugar.

You can also create your own keto-friendly soda at home. Devices like [Sodastream](https://amzn.to/2Roev3z) or the [Hamilton Beach Fizzini](https://amzn.to/2CJisHF) make it possible to create your own keto sodas while controlling every ingredient you use.
