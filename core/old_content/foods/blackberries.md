One of the toughest challenges keto dieters face is the lack of fruit options. Fortunately, delicious blackberries are here to fill the gap.

One cup of blackberries contains 6.2 g of net carbs. They contain 30 mg of Vitamin C, which represents 1/3rd of an adult's [recommended daily consumption](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/). Recent research shows that [eating blackberries may slow down the negative effects of aging on brain health](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf2036033).

If you're looking for a delicious snack between meals, fresh blackberries are an excellent choice. They're also the perfect complement to keto desserts like [cheesecake](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org?q=blackberry%20cheesecake) and [ice cream](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=blackberry%20%22ice%20cream%22).

While fresh blackberries are keto-friendly, canned or dried blackberries are too carb-heavy to fit the keto diet. Manufacturers drench canned blackberries in sugary syrup, and they use dried berries contain tons of added [sugar](/sugar).
