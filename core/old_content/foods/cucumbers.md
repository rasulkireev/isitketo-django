Cucumbers are low in calories and low on the glycemic index. At just 1.6 g of net carbs in a 1/2 cup serving, they're happily low in carbohydrates.

Cucumbers are also rich in vitamins and minerals. They contain antioxidants to fight free radicals, which are unstable atoms that damage cells. 96% of a cucumber is [water](/water), which also makes them a great way to stay hydrated.

Use cucumbers liberally in your salads or as a snack.
