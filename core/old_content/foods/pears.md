Although pears are a nice, sweet fruit and a good source of vitamin C, they're sadly incompatible with the keto diet.

A medium pear contains 22 g of net carbs. Even if you have only a portion of the fruit, a single cup serving has 19.5 g of net carbs.

Asian pears fare a bit better, but they're still tough to fit into your macros. A small Asian pear has 8.6 g of net carbs, and a 100 g serving has 7 g of net carbs, which is _just_ approaching reasonable on a keto diet, though it's still on the high side.

### Alternatives

Unfortunately, only a few [fruits](/category/fruits) have a low enough carb count to fit the keto diet. Berries tend to be your best bet. Here are a few keto-friendly options:

- [Blackberries](/blackberries)
- [Raspberries](/raspberries)
- [Strawberries](/strawberries)
