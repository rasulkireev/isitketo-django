Can you still enjoy America's favorite condiment while staying keto? [Tomatoes](/tomatoes) are keto in moderation, so ketchup *should* be okay, too. Right?

Sadly, the answer is not that simple. A majority of manufacturers sweeten ketchup by adding [sugar](/sugar), which increases the number of carbs per serving. If you check the label on a bottle of regular ketchup, you'll see that it contains 4 g of net carbs per tablespoon. This doesn't sound like much, but most people eat more than a tablespoon of ketchup in one sitting.

If you can't live without ketchup, you have a couple of options. Try a [low sugar ketchup](/heinz-tomato-ketchup-no-sugar-added), many of which only have 1 g of net carbs per tablespoon. As described above, a tablespoon is not a lot of ketchup, so eat in moderation. The second option is to [make your own ketchup](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=ketchup&category=condiment) with tomato paste, low carb sweetener, vinegar, and seasonings.
