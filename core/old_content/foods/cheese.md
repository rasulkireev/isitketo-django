Cheese is a great low-carb source of fats. Although the nutritional content varies by type of cheese, most cheeses are 2 g of net carbs or less per serving. Harder cheeses tend to have fewer carbs.

If you buy packaged, pre-shredded cheese, check the label for carbs, as manufacturers typically add components to prevent the cheese from clumping and this may add to the carb count slightly.
