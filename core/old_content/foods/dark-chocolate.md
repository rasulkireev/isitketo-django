While many enjoy the selection of meats, cheeses, and fish that you can enjoy while keeping keto, it's not long before you miss sweets. Most sweet foods are [sugary](/sugar) and have potential to interfere with ketosis. Fortunately, dark chocolate is a sweet treat that's low enough in carbs to fit into the keto diet.

Dark chocolate is generally keto-friendly provided that it's at least 80% cacao. Be wary of chocolate snacks that have fruit flavors or fillings such as caramel or cream, which are often sugary and non-keto. Always check the label. A good dark chocolate option for keto will be 4 to 6 g of net carbs per serving.

[Lily's](/lilys-chocolate) is an extremely popular chocolate brand within the keto community. Lily's sweetens their chocolate with [erythritol](/erythritol), a sugar alcohol whose carbs your body does not digest, resulting in delicious chocolate that's light on net carbs. For example, their [Dark Chocolate Sea Salt bar](https://amzn.to/2S0xFNi) contains 19 g of net carbs, but 8 g are from fiber and 7 g are from erythritol, leaving only 4 g of net carbs per serving.

Another popular dark chocolate is [Ghiradelli's Intense Dark Squares](https://amzn.to/2W2O5DW). They don't use sugar alcohols, but they're still low in carbs, at only 3 g of net carbs per square.
