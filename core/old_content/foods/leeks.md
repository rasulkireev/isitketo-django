Leeks are closely related to [onions](/onions) and [scallions](/scallions). They have the onion's distinctive taste, but in a milder form.

Each serving of leeks (1 slice) contains 0.7 g of net carbs. If you ate enormous quantities of them, you might find yourself knocked out of ketosis. The normal amount of leeks you'd find in most recipes is so small that the carbs are effectively negligible. Eat them and enjoy!
