Olives are a classic keto-friendly snack. They're low carbs, at only ~1 g of net carb per 15 g serving, and they're a good source of oleic acid, a  monounsaturated fatty acid that helps [reduce the risk of heart disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15642702).

Oloves sell olives in convenient snack packs. They're in small bags that make it easy to snack on olives on the go or as a keto-friendly addition to your lunchbox. The bags don't require refrigeration, making Oloves a flexible and easy snack to keep around. Oloves come in a variety of flavors include lemon & rosemary, chili & oregano, and basil & [garlic](/garlic), all of which are tasty, convenient, and keto.
