Ginger is one of the [most common ingredients in keto recipes](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=ginger). And it's no wonder. It adds a unique flavor to foods without interfering with ketosis.

While ginger technically is mostly carbs, you eat so little of it in meals that the carb count is negligible. A 1 tsp serving contains 0.3 g of net carbs. Even if you love ginger, you'd have to eat an unreasonable amount of it before you start worry about it knocking you out of ketosis.

## Health benefits

Ginger has a number of surprising health benefits. Multiple studies have demonstrated that ginger is [effective at treating nausea](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10793599/). It also [accelerates digestion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016669/) and contains anti-bacterial properties that [may help prevent infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609356/).
