In a regular pizza, the crust contains most of the carbs. A thick-crust slice may contain as many as 30 g of carbs, with a thin-crust slice delivering around 25 g. The sauce can add another 5 g per slice.

If you're craving pizza, you can make your own low-carb version. Rice some [cauliflower](/cauliflower) and fry it to form the crust. Then, add keto-friendly toppings such as [cheese](/cheese), [ham](/ham), [bacon](/bacon) and keto-friendly sauces. Avoid store-bought cauliflower pizza crusts which use high-carb starches.
