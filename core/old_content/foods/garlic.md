What's not to love about garlic? It dispels vampires, it adds delicious flavor to your food, and it has antimicrobial effects that [can improve your skin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10594976/). Okay, garlic breath isn't the best, but garlic is otherwise great.

Each clove of garlic has 0.9 g of net carbs, though few recipes have you eat a whole clove of garlic in each serving. Typically recipes call for one clove of garlic for a 4-serving meal, so garlic generally adds negligible carbs to a recipe.

The low carb count and the effect on flavor make garlic one of the most popular ingredients in keto recipes. [Over one-third of recipes](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=garlic) on KetoHub contain garlic! So if you're considering tossing some garlic into your keto meal, worry not, as it's perfectly compatible.
