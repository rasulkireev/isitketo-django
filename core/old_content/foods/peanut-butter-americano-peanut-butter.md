While most options for packaged peanut butter contain 4 to 13 g of net carbs for ever 2 tablespoon serving, Peanut Butter Americano blows them out of the water with its 1 g net carb peanut butter.

Made with only two simple ingredients, roasted [peanuts](/peanuts) and sea salt, PB Americano achieves a tasty, high fat peanut butter with a carb count so low that it's almost negligible.

Even their flavored varieties like [cinnamon honey](https://amzn.to/2WykWR6) and [white chocolate](https://amzn.to/2D28oZd) contain only 3 to 4 grams of net carbs per serving, making them more keto-friendly than most other brands' standard peanut butter offerings.
