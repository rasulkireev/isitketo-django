Heavy whipping cream is a very popular keto food. It's so common that it's often abbreviated as "HWC."

You can whip it with some vanilla and keto sweetener to make delicious whipped cream. Or you can add it to [scrambled eggs](/eggs) to get a bit more fat and make them fluffier.

There's a common misconception in the keto community that heavy whipping cream is carb-free. Heavy whipping cream, in fact, contains 0.4 g of net carbs per ounce. Nutrition labels list this as 0 g of carbs because food manufacturers are allowed to round down to 0 if the carbs per serving are 0.5 g or below. So, enjoy the whipped cream, but take the carbs into account if you consume large amounts.
