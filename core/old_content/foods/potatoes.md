As much as we love our [french fries](/french-fries), potatoes are not keto-friendly. They are very starchy, which means they carry a very high carb content.

A half-cup serving of potatoes contains 11.5 g of net carbs.

As a general rule, most vegetables that grow underground are not keto-friendly. For a keto-friendly potato substitute, consider [radishes](/radishes) or [cauliflower](/cauliflower).
