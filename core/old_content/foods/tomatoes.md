Does your perfect breakfast include roasted tomatoes with a hint of salt?  Or maybe your salad needs the flavor pop of a cherry tomato.  Perhaps your [scrambled eggs](/eggs) absolutely require fresh salsa.

If your life is incomplete without tomatoes in your day, rest assured that you can enjoy tomatoes frequently while staying in ketosis. Just be aware that they do contain sugar.  One cup of cherry tomatoes contains 4 g of net carbs. This makes tomatoes keto-safe, but you'll need to be mindful of your daily carb count.

Most varieties of tomatoes have similar carb counts, and you'll often see a serving size of 1 cup that has around 3 or 4 g of sugars.  This makes them safe to enjoy, though you can't eat them in unlimited quantities.

While tomatoes are safe, other tomato products might not be.  Read product labels carefully.  Fresh salsa is often safe.  You can use tomato sauce in limited amounts if there are no added sugars.  Be careful with [ketchup](/ketchup) since it's often sweetened.

You can get the most nutrition out of your tomatoes if you [lightly cook them](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article-abstract/122/11/2161/4754717) with a bit of healthy oil like [butter](/butter) or coconut oil. This helps you to absorb their vitamins, minerals, and the antioxidant lycopene.
