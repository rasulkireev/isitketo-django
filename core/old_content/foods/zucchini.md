Whether it's baked, sauteed, or even microwaved, the subtle, earthy flavor of zucchini fits easily into any keto menu. It's low in carbs and calories, too. A 1-cup serving contains only 2.6 g of net carbs, making zucchini a decidedly keto-friendly food.

Zucchini is an excellent substitute for the high-carb foods you love. Craving a loaded baked potato? Slice a zucchini in half and pile it high with [cheese](/cheese), [bacon](/bacon), and [sour cream](/sour-cream). Missing pasta? Spiralize zucchini into spaghetti zoodles! Garnish it with pesto and cheese; you won't taste a difference.

On top of being keto-friendly, zucchini is rich in vitamins. Each cup of zucchini contains almost 30% of your daily vitamin A needs, which supports eye health. Zucchini also contains significant amounts of vitamin C, which can protect against cardiovascular disease, and vitamin B6, which benefits the central nervous system.

Fun fact: Without a farmer there to harvest it, the average zucchini will grow to the size of a baseball bat. You wouldn't want to eat it, though. Large zucchinis are tough and fibrous.
