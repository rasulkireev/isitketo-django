Kale is more than another passing food trend; this leafy green more than lives up to the hype when it comes to flavor and health benefits. A winter vegetable, kale has become so popular in recent years that it's easy to find in most supermarkets year round. It ranges in flavor from a little sweet to peppery and slightly bitter, and it's about to become the most versatile vegetable in your fridge.

With only 0.3 g of net carbs in a 4-cup serving, kale can be a key weapon in your keto arsenal. It can give your [salmon](/salmon) or [steak](/steak) a boost, since it's rich in protein, fiber, vitamin A, and calcium. It also has more vitamin C than any other leafy green.

The two most common types of kale are curly kale and Tuscan kale, also known as lacinato or dinosaur kale. Curly kale, which you can identify by its crinkled edges, is delicious roasted, braised, or sautéed. It also makes for flavorful salads, but be sure to let any dressing sit on it for a bit before digging in; that gives the acid and oil time to work together to soften the hearty leaves. Some people even massage their curly kale for added tenderness. No matter how you prepare it, be sure to cut out the thick stems from the centers of the leaves.

Tuscan kale, on the other hand, is more tender than its curly compatriot, meaning you can cook it quickly (as in sautéing) or you can toss a handful into soup without worrying about sogginess.

With so many cooking options, this vegetable-du-jour (seriously, this stuff is everywhere) is an easy addition to any keto main dish.
