Diet Coke is one of the most popular sodas in the world, and that's good news for keto fans because its zero carb content make it keto-friendly.

This diet soda gets its sweet taste from [acesulfame potassium](/acesulfame-potassium), which people sometimes refer to as "Ace K." Acesulfame potassium is an unpopular ingredient in the keto community, though more than [100 FDA-reviewed studies](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/additional-information-about-high-intensity-sweeteners-permitted-use-food-united-states) support its safety as a sweetener.

For a soda with more natural ingredients, consider [Zevia](/zevia-soda). It's sweetened with [stevia](/stevia), a natrual, keto-friendly sweetener that does not increase blood sugar.

One of the biggest challenges of a keto diet is staying properly hydrated. It's fine to mix in a bit of soda for taste, but the best way to hydrate is by drinking plenty of [water](/water).
