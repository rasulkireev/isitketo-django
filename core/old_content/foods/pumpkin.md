Pumpkins are closely associated with American holidays like Thanksgiving or Halloween. It could be because the carb count in pumpkins is enough to frighten most keto dieters.

Each serving of pumpkin (1 cup, 1" cubes) contains 7 g of net carbs. That's higher than you'd like to be for a vegetable, but you can fit in small amounts if you've got a strong hankering for pumpkin.

Consider limiting yourself to half a portion per day to avoid going over your carb limits.
