Trader Joe's Ranch Dressing can make a great dipping sauce for your [buffalo wings](/buffalo-wings) or a nice topping for your [keto salad](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=salad).

At only 3 g of carbs per 2 Tbsp serving, this dressing should be easy to fit within your daily macros. Each serving also provides 12 g of fats. As with any [salad dressing](/salad-dressing), Trader Joe's Ranch is easy to overeat, so be mindful of your portion sizes to ensure you're staying within your macronutrient limits.

* [Primal Kitchen Ranch](/primal-kitchen-ranch-dressing): Contains 15 g of fat, 2 g of net carbs, and all-natural ingredients.
