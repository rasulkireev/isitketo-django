Quest earned a solid reputation in the keto world with their [protein bars](/quest-protein-bars), so many were excited to see them branch out into protein cookies. In the keto world, it's hard to find cookies that aren't packed with carbs from wheat flour and brown sugar.

Fortunately, Quest came to the rescue with their protein cookies. At only 4 g of net carbs, these cookies aren't difficult to fit within your daily carb limits. With 17 g of fat and 15 g of protein in each cookie, they'll help you achieve your daily macros while you're enjoying a delicious treat. They also contain 9 g of fiber, which explains why so many of the people who try them describe them as filling.

For a satisfying treat, try warming these cookies up in the microwave for 20 seconds to enjoy that warm, just-out-of-the-oven sensation.

Alternatively, [Fat Snax](/fat-snax-cookies) offers a keto-friendly cookie that's lower in net carbs, but also has less fat and protein. Take your pick depending on which taste you prefer and what you need to meet your macros for the day.
