Each serving of limes (1 fruit, 2" diameter) contains 5.2 g of net carbs. That's a sizeable amount, but limes are still one of the most keto-friendly fruits you can find.

You'll often find limes as part of [keto recipes](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org/?q=lime) for their juice, which is fairly keto-friendly as well.
